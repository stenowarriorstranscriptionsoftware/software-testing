1: "Now Sir hon’ble Members will recall that the Bill was introduced in the House of the people on the 2nd September 1953. It has had a long history and in one form or another it has been before the public since the end of 1949. In the Statement of Objects and Reasons the various stages through which the Bill has passed since 1946 have been summarised and I need not recapitulate on this occasion the circumstances in which the then Government of India took the decision in early 1946 to initiate an enquiry into the reform of our company law. I would remind hon’ble Members that between 1946 and 1948 the entire field of company law was carefully reviewed by two distinguished company lawyers who were appointed to recommend the broad lines on which the present Act should be revised. Their recommendations were examined in the then Ministry of Commerce and certain tentative departmental views which emerged were circulated in a comprehensive memorandum to all recognised trade and industrial associations BAR associations the High Courts and the State Governments. That brought us to the end of 1949. Many representations on this memorandum were duly received from Chambers of Commerce trade and industrial associations State Governments and the general public. At the end of 1950 the Government of India appointed a Committee under the Chairmanship of Shri Bhabha to go into the entire question of the revision of the Companies Act with particular reference to its bearing on the development of trade and industry in this country. This Committee examined a large number of witnesses in many parts of the country and submitted its report in March 1952. This report again was circulated to all State Governments Chambers of Commerce Trade Associations High Courts and many other bodies. At the same time a Special Officer was appointed in the Department of Economic Affairs Ministry of Finance to examine the report in the light of the views received from the interested public and to submit proposals to Government for the revision of the present Act. The Bill now before the House is based largely on the recommendations of the Company Law Committee modified in a few particulars. Hon’ble Members will notice that so far as public relations go the Bill has covered adequate ground. In a measure like the Companies Bill however which covers the entire field of the operation of joint stock companies the limits of consultation and discussion can never be exhausted and I would like to inform hon’ble Members that although the Bill was introduced in Parliament over seven months ago our officers have been engaged throughout this period in further studies and informal discussions with the interests concerned and on occasion I have also participated in such discussions. I have also given some further thought to some of the issues arising out of the Bill and I propose at the appropriate stage to bring before the Select Committee any changes in the provisions of the Bill which seem to me to be worthy of consideration in the light of this further examination. No hon’ble Members will have noticed that the Bill contains 6 clauses and 12 schedules. I think it is probably one of the longest legislative measures in recent legislative history. But its size might be regarded as misleading unless I make a few comments. The Bill is both one must remember a consolidating and amending measure. As mentioned in the Statement of Objects and Reasons this is the first opportunity which has occurred since 1923 for the consolidation of the Companies Act. Advantage has been taken of this opportunity to redraft several long and complicated sections in the present Act which have been split up into a large number of clauses. This is the largest single factor accountable for the increase in the number of clauses in the Bill. New clauses embodying substantial changes in the present law would hardly constitute more than a small fraction of the Bill. I would also draw attention to the structural changes in the Bill to which a reference has been made in the Statement of Objects and Reasons. The redraft of the Bill and the rearrangement of the existing chapters in the companies Act in a more logical order have I think resulted in a noticeable improvement in the form of the Bill and I hope will facilitate better understanding and appreciation of the scheme. I wish that the Act which came into effect long ago was implemented properly. I know that the Minister here is very earnest in implementing it but unfortunately his colleagues at the State level are disappointing him. Unfortunately no steps have been taken for trimming or toning up the administration at the State level and at the district level. They have to be taken immediately.",
2: "I should like now to make a few observations on the Budget. This Budget marks a turning point in the history of our country. It is no use attempting as some of my friends have done either to deprecate the budget very strongly or to suggest that we are not witnessing a new revolution in our methods of fiscal training and technique. I want it to be quite clearly pointed out to my friends that we are now facing the lean years of Indian finance. Hitherto we had revenue surpluses which were a form of public saving and which were meant to be utilised for capital development. Hereafter this form of revenue surplus would not be available. We have therefore to find out ways and means of implementing our great programme of national reconstruction at minimum cost. My point is that the deficit on revenue account would be of the order of about Rs. 19 to 20 crores. Here let me point out that I do not agree with those of my friends in the Finance Department who have attempted to suggest that Rs. 9 or 18 crores which are obtained from Pakistan should be put to the revenue side of the budget; they are to be put on the capital side. But that does not seriously alter the trend of my argument. What I am suggesting is that we would have to be prepared for a deficit of a much higher order even on the revenue side. That itself should make us realise that there are very many problems which we have to face and that we have to undertake ways and means of increasing the resources of our country so that it might be possible for us to have a greater amount of surplus or a greater amount of public saving for the purpose of financing capital development. The Finance Minister in the course of his speech Mr. Deputy Minister pointed out that the deficits during the past two years were of the order of Rs. 83 crores. I venture humbly to disagree with him because I feel that when we are talking of deficits we must take into account the overall deficit incurred by the Central Government and that would be of the order of Rs. 200 crores. During the years of relatively light expenditure we had a shortfall of about Rs. 200 crores. Undoubtedly now when we are going to have a very great amount of expenditure we might have a greater amount of deficit and we would have to find out ways and means of trying to meet our capital expenditure. Some Members have pointed out that deficit financing is good; others have pointed out that it is poison. One hon’ble Member who preceded me pointed out that it could be taken like a tonic. Now I am not willing to enter into the merits of deficit financing or demerits of deficit financing in an academic spirit. The time has now come when we should face realities. I do suggest that we have to indulge in deficit financing because without indulging in deficit financing it would not be possible for us to indulge in capital expenditure on such a large scale. But when we are talking of the scope of deficit financing we would like to place before the House and the Finance Minister the two great limitations which face us. The first limitation that faces us is that concerning the internal price level. The hon’ble the Finance Minister referred to the cost of living. He said that he was going to keep a watch over the cost of living so that it may not shoot up within a short period and make a mess of the plans of capital development. But there is another limitation which has also to be borne in mind a limitation which has not received as much notice as it should have done in all the discussions that have taken place on deficit financing. That limitation is the external limitation or the limitation which arises on account of our balance of payments position. I think this is as important Mr. Deputy Speaker as the internal price level and I should like to elaborate that particular point a bit more because I feel that a time will shortly arrive when we might have either to reconsider our policy or might even have to leave the sterling club of which we are a member. The second serious limitation is as serious as the first. What would be the consequences of deficit financing on our balance of payments? The Finance Minister in his budget speech points out that so far as the balance of payments position is concerned they have now whether it is by accident or design a favourable balance and they have contributed about Rs. 63 crores to the dollar pool during the past six months. But the moment we indulge in deficit financing we have to be prepared for worsening of our balance of payments.",
3: "I am thankful to you for having given me this opportunity long last to say a few words on the Budget. Already much has been said and I think the Finance Minister has come in for his share of congratulations as well as criticisms. So there is not very much to say but I should like to say a few words. The increased development expenditure and the absence of any new taxation has earned for the Budget a good response even from the businessmen. I specially welcome the relief given to the middle classes by raising the exemption limit of income tax in respect of personal income. No doubt this is some relief to the middle classes. But I would request the Finance Minister if he could to raise this exemption limit from Rs. 4000 to Rs. 6000 as that would give substantial relief to the middle classes. I am indeed glad that the Taxation Enquiry Commission has been appointed with Dr. John Mathai as the Chairman and I am sure that many of the vexed problems may be solved through this Commission. At the same time I would request the Finance Minister to put off the Estate Duty Bill for the present since this Enquiry Commission has been appointed and they may go into this question. For I feel that it is not an opportune moment to put on more taxes on the people. Already as Mr. Gadgil has pointed out there are so many taxes on the people. The people are over-burdened by taxes and they are just trying to recover their stability. So in regard to Estate Duty I would ask him to consider about it. My reason for asking it to be postponed is as I have said that the people are still facing economic distress. And then our Government is not able to offer the amenities which other countries have where the Estate Duty exists such as free compulsory education for children free medical aid homes for the poor and the destitute old age pension etc. So my humble suggestion is that this point may be considered by the Taxation Enquiry Commission. I agree that there is a brighter side of the picture and that instead of continually harping on our poverty we should also see the bright side. We are making encouraging progress towards laying the foundation of a welfare state. With the co-operation of all and the implementation of the Five Year Plan I am sure Sir that we should be able to lay the foundations and fulfil the dreams of India. It is indeed encouraging to know from the Finance Minister that there is a tendency of lowering food prices all over the world and in that case the prices in our country too would be lowered. Regarding Defence for obvious security reasons I do not agree with my friends who say that the expenditure should be curtailed. It is not advisable to take any undue risks and slacken the defence arrangements. Indeed defence is one of our valuable assets although strange to say there seems to be adverse opinion in some quarters. I agree with what General Cariappa once said that God and Army are remembered only when there is trouble. The Army consists of the most disciplined and loyal set of young men. It would not be proper to effect economy in the pay of these brave officers as it would not be an incentive for the right type of young men to join the Army and it would become ineffective and inefficient. I believe already officers who were drawing Rs. 1400 as their pay are now getting only Rs. 700 and about Rs. 100 as allowance. That is they are getting about half of what they were getting before. It is very hard for those officers on field duty to establish separate establishments for their families and for their children and I would specially appeal to the Finance Minister to see that the family allowances may be restored to those officers who are on field duty. Economy in Army could be effected in other ways. There is scope for more efficient operation of defence industries which process seems slow and by purchase policy of utilising goods and stores indigenously manufactured. Preferences should be given to country-made war materials such as could be produced here and they would be cheaper than foreign-made goods. I may also suggest that the Armed Forces who are not on field service or under any operational commitments could be utilised for giving military training to the youths in schools and colleges which would teach discipline and loyalty. The University authorities should make military training as part of their compulsory education just as they have adopted social domestic and political sciences. The National Cadet Corps is already incalculating military training in some Universities such as Bombay and Calcutta. But if military training is made compulsory for our university students it will go a long way.",
4: "Sir the Essential Commodities Act was passed five years ago and when the Minister yesterday came with an amending Bill we expected that he would give us a brief report on the working of this measure for the last few years. But unfortunately we are kept in the dark in regard to the exact working of the Act and the nature of the difficulties the Minister is facing. Sir as far as I know many of the provisions of this enactment have been observed more in violation by his agents at the State level. The Food Minister may be very earnest may be very able and may be very anxious to see that the various provisions of the Act are implemented in the most effective manner at the State level but unfortunately his agents at the State level are not equally enthusiastic or equally anxious to observe the provisions of this enactment. The most important objectives of this enactment are to control the supply and distribution of commodities and to maintain a stable price level. In regard to both these aspects I am afraid that the Government has failed to realise the objectives in view. Some time past when there was scarcity of foodgrains attempts were made to make procurement from certain wholesale merchants and from rice mills. In my own State I know of many instances of such procurement where after making known that certain things had to be done and certain steps had to be taken by the merchant community nothing was done later on by the Government when they found that these very orders of the Government were violated. As a result of the violations there was a consequent rise in the prices of foodgrains. In respect of other commodities like iron and steel paper etc. we see a lot of speculative activities but the provisions of the Act have not been brought to bear on them. Perhaps no case of prosecution was launched against those people who contravened the various provisions of the Act. We are interested to know in how many cases the Government have taken steps to prosecute individuals who have violated the various sections of the Act. The Minister said that the powers under the Act were not adequate. We sympathise with the Food Minister but I want to know what action has been taken in this regard by the various State Governments. In regard to the amending provision I want to know from the Minister what would be his difficulty even if minor offences are taken to courts of law. For instance the Motor Vehicles Act deals with various offences both major and minor and various minor offences under the Act are taken to courts and people are prosecuted. What is the difficulty in taking these cases of a minor nature to courts of law? There the people will have some safety that they will get a hearing and if the offences are really offences then they would be prosecuted. Otherwise they will be acquitted. Here the Minister says that there should be a security deposit. If there is a violation of a particular provision of the enactment then the executive authority will have the power either to confiscate a part of the amount or the whole of the amount. We are clothing the executive authority with more powers. I do not grudge giving powers to the executive authority provided they are used properly and effectively and in a most fair manner. But unfortunately there have been discriminations apart from the ineffectiveness of the various provisions. Wherever these provisions were used there had been discriminatory use of these provisions against a few or in favour of a few. Normally when officers are clothed with more powers there is a large scope for corruption. I feel that it would be desirable to avoid such malpractices and it would be desirable I think that even for minor offences the parties should have a chance to defend their actions. I do not think that this problem of dealing with minor offences will become complex or complicated in any way if we take them to courts of law. I want a reply from the Minister in what way he is suffering from a handicap in dealing with minor offences or offences of a technical nature. The hon’ble Member made the point that even if this thing was acceptable to the House he did not know what amount would be demanded as security. So the Minister should tell us what amount is normally expected from a licensee in all cases and what the offences are which are of a technical or minor nature which he has in view. We are not told which are major offences and which are minor offences. Clarifications on these points are necessary. I wish that the Act which came into effect long ago was implemented properly. I know that the Minister here is very earnest in implementing it but his colleagues at the State level and at the Central level are disappointing him.",
5: "The Industrial Policy Resolution of 1948 was good so far as it went. But unfortunately the spirit of it could not be understood or appreciated by the common man in this country. So a new orientation of this policy was given. And the hon’ble Prime Minister after his return from China publicly declared that the future policy of the country or rather the future pattern of society will be the socialist pattern. That was further emphasised by the resolution passed at the Avadi session of the congress and later reiterated by Shri Dhebar President of the Indian National Congress. I am very glad to say that the spirit of it has been caught by the nation today. If I may say so the nation has taken up the challenge for securing the socialist pattern of society. It behoves all sections both inside this House as well as outside without having mutual recriminations to try and propagate in a sincere manner and establish the socialist pattern of society indicated by the statements of the great leaders of our country. It may be relevant and pertinent if I refer to a few sentences from the memorandum presented on the 4th June 1939 by our Prime Minister who was the Chairman of the All India Planning Committee which came into existence when there was provincial autonomy in the provinces. On pages 39 and 40 of that report he stated: It is clear that the drawing up of a comprehensive national plan becomes clearly an academic exercise with no relation to reality unless the planning authority or those to whom it is responsible are in a position to give effect to the plan. If this authority is powerless or circumscribed or restricted and has limited activities it cannot plan. An essential pre-requisite for planning is thus complete freedom and independence for the country and removal of all outside control. This implies that the country possesses in itself full sovereign authority to take any measures adopt any policies and form any relations with other countries as may seem best to its governing authority in the interests of the country and its people. National independence is thus an indispensable preliminary for taking all the steps that might be found necessary for carrying out the five year plan in all its various aspects throughout the whole country. At the present moment it is clear that not only have we in India no national independence but we are hedged in and obstructed by numerous restrictions limitations safeguard and reservations which block the path to planning and progress. Our plan for national development must therefore be drawn up for a free and independent India. Thanks to the sacrifices made by millions of our countrymen and country-women under the leadership of the Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi we have today secured complete sovereign political independence at a time when the nations of the world were engaged in the bitterest struggle using all the weapons of destruction. If therefore we have secured political independence during the period of a quarter of a century it should not be difficult especially when we are today masters in our own country to secure a socialist pattern of society as has already been indicated. But it requires the assistance the propaganda the active work of all those who are interested in this. I am sure so long as my hon’ble friends the Minister the Deputy Minister and the other Minister who represent the Commerce and Industry Ministry can give us an assurance that the capitalist pattern would be avoided some of us who believe in a cent per cent socialist democracy give an undertaking that certainly totalitarian policy will not be introduced in this country because we have believed all along during the fight that we have given to the British Government when we secured political independence that we shall try to maintain democracy undiluted and a socialist democracy at that. I am absolutely certain that in this country of ours liberty of thought liberty of speech and liberty of action will be guaranteed to every citizen to express his views in the manner he pleases. I therefore assure my hon’ble friend that so long as we do not in the garb of a socialist pattern support a capitalist system India will stand hundred per cent for a socialist democracy. Now luckily for us the Fundamental Rights of the Constitution have declared that a citizen would be assured of many of the social amenities which will give reasonable comfort from the womb to the grave. But mere enunciation as I have said many times will not satisfy the common man unless the saying is put into effect. I am absolutely certain therefore that so long as there is a determination on the part of our countrymen we will be in a position to secure a socialist pattern of society. It is not even possible to draw up a plan on any other basis.",
6: "There has been some reference to the improvement in our economic situation also. We find that we have made good progress in production. We were faced equally with a difficult situation so far as cloth was concerned. There was a deficit of food and there was also shortage of cloth. I do remember the scenes that we had to witness in several cities where people had to stand in queues for hours together for two yards of very ordinary cloth but now the situation is quite changed. We have produced much cloth and we are in a position to export cloth. During the British period we were required to import cloth but now we are in a position to export cloth. After partition we were faced with the question of raw material namely cotton. We had cotton mills but cotton remained in Pakistan. Even that problem has been solved. We had placed before us a target for more production of cotton and not only has that target been achieved but it has been achieved in shorter period to the satisfaction of all people in the country. From this survey Sir you will find that everybody should be convinced that we are making good progress in the realisation of the objectives of the Five Year plan. Then there is a reference that in several essential commodities we have got increased production. This cannot be denied. In spite of this increased production I must admit we have not been able to solve the question of unemployment but efforts are being made to ease the situation so far as this question is concerned. The main thing to which I would like to refer is that the President was pleased to say and say very plainly that so far as cottage industries were concerned we have not been able to make good progress. As a matter of fact very little progress has been made. If in this country we have to solve the question of unemployment we must take and take very seriously to the development of cottage industries. That alone will solve this problem of unemployment. We want to increase production but we want to take to such means for increasing our production as would be man-absorbing and not man-saving as have been resorted to by the western countries. That alone will solve our problem to a great extent. If we organise our cottage industries if we take to the spirit of Swadeshi I have no doubt we will solve the problem of unemployment to a great extent. Then Sir a reference has been made to certain additional projects which have been included in the Five Year Plan. There was a great demand from Maharashtra to include this project in the Five Year Plan. A couple of years ago there was a conference presided over by my colleague from the district the present Revenue Minister of Maharashtra. He had presided over it and there was a unanimous demand supported by practically the entire people from Maharashtra that this project should be included in the Five Year Plan. I take this opportunity to congratulate the Government of India and the Government of Maharashtra for having seen to it that this project in Maharashtra is included in the Five Year Plan. The President’s Address makes reference to the improvement of our transport and communications. Our increased production leads to the question of better transport facilities. The agricultural production is on the increase but Sir if there is no betterment of our transport facilities this increased production in agriculture will not benefit the agriculturist. In my part of the country even now this situation prevails. The production there is on the increase but the agriculturists are suffering on account of inadequate facilities of railway transport. I was glad to find from the President’s Address that the Railways are thinking of opening even new lines very soon. It has also been said that so far as locomotives and rolling stock are concerned the manufacture of these is going on very satisfactorily and we have made good progress in this respect during the last few years. Any nation can be proud of this achievement. Then there is a reference to the housing conditions. We can very well remember the scenes that we were required to witness immediately after partition. Thousands and tens of thousands of our brethren came to this country from Pakistan. It was a very serious question as to how to house them but the day has come when the question has practically been solved or it can at least be said that we are near the solution of the question. Seventy two crores of rupees have been spent during the last few years in constructing houses for the refugees and in this very city we are witnessing an exhibition where we can see the models of cheap and decent houses. If these cheap houses are constructed for the refugees it will provide shelter for them at a low cost.",
7: "Now I would like to say that with this measure we are now adopting to my mind it will not be possible to have this system or any other system functioning effectively. The number of clauses that we have included are so restrictive and rigid that it will not be possible for any system to function in this country. If at all it is able to function it will be able to function with a lot of difficulties. It will be said afterwards that the industrial sector particularly the private sector has not been able to deliver the goods. I would like to warn the Government that if anything happens in the future in which industrial production or production in the private sector has not gone up it would be not because of any lack of efforts on the part of the private sector but because of the measure that we are now adopting. I have mentioned several times how this particular Bill is very restrictive and how it will hamper the normal growth of companies in this country. It is a pity that when we are on the threshold of the Second Five Year Plan such a measure should be passed in this House. I would now like to make a few observations about the speeches of some of the hon’ble Members here. Shri Ashoka Mehta justifies the restrictions on managing agents by saying that managing agents are no longer the main source of finance. He also argues that profits have been high and will continue to remain high and therefore he would like to see the managing agents being paid on a sliding scale. He is in the habit of referring to a number of books and making quotations from a number of them published in America or in other countries and particularly by some of the professors. I would also like to mention to him that even when companies are floated it requires a certain amount of confidence amongst the investing public and it is because a particular firm is managing a particular company that this confidence is created in the investing public. Even there as the hon’ble Finance Minister has said there is a sort of overall tight control. New banks and insurance companies are not floated nowadays. What you have are the few banks which are existing and the few insurance companies that are existing. The other point is that the credit-worthiness of the managing agency firm does count to a certain extent in getting credit from the banks and other financial institutions. Yesterday it was mentioned by my hon’ble friend that the crux of the problem is the question of payment of remuneration to a particular managing agency system. He said that in this Bill a definite encouragement has been given to the alternative type of management namely the managing director or the manager where an individual has been permitted to take 5 per cent while in the case of the managing agency it has been permitted to take about 10 per cent. I would like to point out to him that it is not merely the question of remuneration which will decide the alternative type of management. The remuneration is not a very important thing. Unless and until you allow a certain amount of flexibility for any system to function it will not be possible to evolve any other system to take the place of the managing agency system. In spite of so many shackles you may find that those few business houses which are carrying on now may have to carry on on the present basis you may not find many new people coming in the field. Several times it has been mentioned in this House why the business community has not prescribed for itself a code of conduct. In this connection I would like to point out that a degree or diploma is essential for the profession and in case of violation of the code sanction should be provided by it to prevent a person from practising the profession. Today even Ashoka Mehta and Shri C.C. Shah can set up a grocery shop and become businessmen. Nobody lays down any condition for starting business and nobody can prevent others from continuing it but I would like to point out that with regard to the code of conduct there is a certain amount of ethics and there are certain standards and traditions on which business houses function. If a particular firm has not got proper ways of managing its business you will find that that business house will find it difficult to function and it would be difficult for it to command the confidence of the business community. It would not be possible for it to function as effectively as a firm which has proper ways of managing its business. That is sufficient as a code of conduct. It is not possible to prescribe a certain code of conduct in the manner it has been done for the profession in general.",
8: "In conclusion I would like to say a word in regard to employment with which I have been dealing so far. According to the figures supplied the number of displaced persons from Bangladesh employed through employment exchanges is only 37000. This is very meagre compared with their total number which comes to 32 lakhs according to the official figures. This is with regard to Bangladesh refugees. The number of displaced persons from Pakistan employed through employment exchanges is not very encouraging but still it is 75000. I would urge upon the hon’ble Minister to take this into consideration and see that something is done to find employment for these people. Of course there is some expenditure incurred on general education and vocational training but when we look at the number of persons who have been given vocational training we find that the number already trained and under training is only 17000. This figure also seems to be very small considering the magnitude of the problem before us. Some programmes of general improvement have been undertaken by the Government of West Bengal by way of setting up new industries etc. These programmes should be looked into and put into operation with a view to giving more employment to these displaced persons. Within the limited time at my disposal I shall limit my remarks to refugees from Bangladesh. The first thing which strikes one as one looks at the various brochures and publications that have been given to us is the amount of contradiction one has to battle against. The first contradiction is in regard to the number of persons Government think they have rehabilitated in West Bengal. Granting that it is difficult to make a final assessment of the number of refugees who have come from Bangladesh it is still true to say that at least there should be some sort of parity between what the Union Ministry says and what the West Bengal Rehabilitation Ministry says. Only a few days ago the West Bengal Minister of Rehabilitation said that there are 22 lakhs of refugees who have to be rehabilitated but the Central Government’s figures are 31 lakhs. Unless the Government know the number of people they have to budget for it is rather bewildering to know how they mean to plan in bringing about their rehabilitation. As a matter of fact many other sources believe that the figure is far higher but in any case there should be some parity and some ideas to the extent of the rehabilitation problem which still remains before the people of West Bengal. The other contradiction is this. On the one hand Shrimati Renuka Ray says that in the near future they will be making a successful completion of the work of economic rehabilitation of refugees in that State but only last year Shri A.P. Jain said that as yet the problem of the displaced persons from Bangladesh was a matter which was giving some concern. I really do not understand why in spite of Shri A.P. Jain recognising that the problem is still quite serious Shrimati Renuka Ray should have made such a statement. Yet when we heard the hon’ble Finance Minister we find that there has been a shortfall in rehabilitation budget. I think that if the Fact Finding Committee’s Report had been published the assessment that we have rehabilitated about fifty per cent of the people of Bangladesh who came over as displaced persons would have become quite clear in regard to its incorrectness. As a matter of fact when we went round the camps and colonies in West Bengal we found that as yet not more than fifteen per cent of the people have been rehabilitated in the sense that they are able to eke out their subsistence on the poorest levels. It is not more than fifteen per cent and I think the figures of the Fact Finding Committee are still lower. I think this is something that we have to take very seriously and put our minds to and apply all the resources that we have to find out how we will be able to tackle this problem of rehabilitation. Now coming to the question of relief I feel that until we are able to give really proper rehabilitation we cannot withdraw relief. It is no use arguing whether relief leads to lethargy and moral slackness. Unless our rehabilitation policies are fruitful have we any right to stave the people to death? As a matter of fact Shri A.P. Jain may know that in West Bengal the incidence of Tuberculosis amongst the refugee population is very high. Only a small percentage of them is catered for by the medical relief given by the Directorate of Rehabilitation. If I am to tell you the tragic fate of the refugees in West Bengal I would refer you to a report which appeared in February 1954.",
9: "Sir the Budget has been variously described and criticised as one that increases the burden of the common man one which gives concessions to the rich and encourages foreign investments. I agree Sir that it is all this and much more. But it certainly is not a highway man’s budget. To my mind Sir the Budget is sincere conscientious and at the same time it is a bold effort on the part of the Finance Minister who is charged with heavy responsibility of finding resources for the Third Five Year Plan. This Plan to my mind Sir is not at all ambitious in view of our needs. It may be looked upon as a rather heavy demand but looking to our needs it is not very ambitious. Sir the fact that even the considerations of the coming general elections could not deflect the Finance Minister from the course which seemed to him necessary and proper should earn him the appreciation of every right thinking man. The common man’s interest as I said is nearer to our hearts than perhaps some others can claim or at least it is equally nearer to us and yet there come times in a nation’s history when it becomes necessary for the people to postpone the fruits of their labour and enterprise to secure the future. Here also Sir opinions may differ. According to the Communist Party such a time came during the last Great War when they were exhorting people the common people to contribute their full mite to the war effort. According to us however Sir we are passing through such a time at the present moment and I have no doubt that the common people appreciate this position and will willingly tighten their belts contribute their full mite and will surely return the Congress to power having full confidence in the future and looking to a future where their posterity will be assured of a far better social and economic order. Who Sir does not sympathise with the difficulties of the common man? As a matter of fact most of us come from that class and I am sure the Finance Minister would have liked to do away with some of the levies. None would have been happier if he could have done without these new levies but there are Sir certain very imperative limitations. We are passing through a critical period. Sir it may not be necessary to continue these levies for a long time; rather I am inclined to think that before long it may be possible to give up some of them at least. I have very valid reasons to think so. Our public undertakings are coming to their own and some of our important irrigation and power projects have just been completed. Some others are nearing completion and in due course. I think in the very near future they must yield returns. This will go a long way to lighten the burden of the common man. We might Sir also resort to some other ways. I suggest that we might take to public trading in some specific items of export and import. That would also certainly go a long way and help us. The private corporate sector has been steadily growing and has been developing capacity. It is sure to benefit from all these present concessions and develop greater capacity. This sector must come forward to meet new demands for taxation in the future. I agree that so far as indirect taxation is concerned it has reached the saturation point but the corporate sector growing as it is in strength in vitality and in capacity will not I am sure shirk its responsibility to contribute to the common fund. I wish Sir the committee which had been appointed to go into where the additional national income had gone had entered upon its labours a bit earlier and had made its findings available to us. I do not want to state its findings but I have a feeling that the committee when it concludes its labours will come to the conclusion that a major portion of this additional national income has gone into the pockets of a comparatively small number of men small number of individuals. And it is they who must in future contribute their share to the country’s taxation needs because the profits they have earned are not all due to their own efforts and enterprise only. To a very large measure they are the result of the economic policies of the Government and due to certain other circumstances to which they did not contribute anything. Therefore there is ample justification for the two taxes the capital gains tax and the excess profits tax. I need not go in details into all the reasons that my hon’ble friend has explained earlier so lucidly but I must say that I entirely agree with them all. Having said this I would like to say a few words about allocations which have been made to the various Ministries in the Budget.",
10: "In discussing the Demands for Grants of the Finance Ministry we have got to see to what extent the administration of this particular Ministry has led to the development of our national wealth and the securing of the welfare which our State claims to have in view. Madam we must try to analyse very carefully the working of this particular Ministry because it is not merely a department of the Government so to say but it is the nerve centre of the administration of the country. I would like first to refer to the role of foreign capital because in determining the manner in which the permission of capital issues has been granted by the particular administration we should keep in our mind to what extent the interests of our nation have been served. I fully endorse the statement which the previous speaker has made so far as repatriation of the investments made by foreigners and of profits are concerned. We have dealt with this topic quite a number of times and I do not want to reiterate anything apart from only supporting what the hon’ble Member who just now spoke said. I would now like to deal with the investments of foreigners in India. Madam the Government of our country accepted the proposition that in allowing foreign investment it should come in only in such industry and such form of production wherein our national investors will not come forward and in which technical skill is wanted. There is also one other factor which the industrial policy of our Government of 1948 as adumbrated further in 1949 by the Prime Minister laid down. It specifically said that the control and ownership of such concerns should as far as possible be in the hands of Indian nationals and the technical know-how of our country should be developed. I would like to emphasise the figures that have been put forward for the last few years. From 1947 till the end of 1952 or the early part of 1952 it has been reported that Rs. 19 crores of foreign capital have been allowed to be invested in our country. Of that practically more than Rs. 6 crores have been allowed to be invested in managing agency and trading enterprises in our country. So far as the Government policy is concerned we find that a sum of Rs. 4 crores has been allowed to be invested this year. We do not know how it is to be used up. We have been told that during the period 1948-53 nearly Rs. 35 lakhs have been allowed to be invested in textile machinery and generally in the textile industry. We have seen to what extent cotton and jute have been dominated by the national capital and to what extent they play the role as against the demand for them. We know further what the Government is doing in regard to these industries and how the Indian counterpart in these industries are behaving. Then why this further penetration of foreign capital? Even in regard to the expansion scheme we find that paints soaps electric fans and machine tools are some of the industries where the Government is allowed foreign interest to establish or expand their factories. It will adversely compete with the production of the country when the indigenous producers do not find any market in this sphere. Therefore we have got to see to what extent the capital issue has been regulated by this Government and particularly by the Finance Department so that the national well-being of the country could be guaranteed. Then we have got to look into the fact as to how far the new industries are allowed to function. So far as the oil refineries are concerned some of them have been established and some more are going to be established very soon. In the control of the administration the Indians have no share. There are only preference shareholders and they have now voice in the management. So far as the administrative aspect in this industry is concerned the most important part of it is the technical know-how. They do not guarantee that they will train the Indians. That means they say even after 20 years we will have to face the problem of the know-how in respect of the oil refineries. I do not know why the Government are showing softness to foreigners in this matter. Then we have another investment in collaboration with the Indian Chemical Industries for the manufacture of civil explosives. Here as far as I have gathered only 20 per cent is going to be Indian capital. The majority of the shares will remain with the Indian Chemical Industries. Nobody else has been allowed to make any investment. It would have been better if other companies and private individuals had been given an opportunity to purchase the shares.",
11: "Sir several questions raised regarding the Defence Ministry and the External Affairs and Irrigation Ministries have been clarified by my colleagues from those Ministries. My task therefore has been simplified to that extent. Before I go to the questions financial and economic raised by several hon’ble Members I should like to clarify one or two points which are more administrative than economic or financial. One of them was raised by my hon’ble friend. He raised the question about the recruitment by the Assistant Superintendents’ Departmental Competitive examination and particularly about the examination held in 1960. He said that about Rs. 6 lakhs were spent for the 1960 examination and later it was declared that no vacancies were available. He therefore suggested that a definite procedure should be there and the examination should be held according to the vacancies declared in advance and all persons who have qualified in that examination should be eligible for promotion or for appointment. Sir I do not know whether the hon’ble Member knows how these vacancies are filled. He probably refers to the Section officers’ Grade in the Central Secretariat Service. This is filled 50 per cent by direct recruitment and 25 per cent by departmental competitive examination open to the Assistants i.e. the next lower grade and the rest 25 per cent by promotion of the Assistants on the basis of seniority subject to fitness. The examination therefore that he was referring to was a departmental competitive examination for filling 25 per cent of the vacancies. It takes about one year for the Union Public Service Commission to declare the results of the examination from the time they take up the question of the examination. It is not therefore possible to declare the number of vacancies to be filled in from the very beginning. To declare them just when the results are out is more realistic and that is what is done. Sir if the examination is treated as qualifying examination the number of persons who will thus become eligible for appointment will be quite unrelated to the number of vacancies to be filled in and then the very situation which the hon’ble Member wishes to avoid would arise. It would not then be possible to hold any of the examinations at regular intervals and promotions against this quota would become very fitful. The hon’ble Member also suggested that the rules for recruitment and promotion etc. Should be uniform for all Ministries whether participating in the Central Secretariat Service Scheme or not. It must be and this is so except for the Ministry of External Affairs and the Railways. These have different rules but these rules are very much similar and there is not much difference. But because these persons are recruited for different purposes and by different agencies they are separate. Therefore his purpose in saying that there should be uniformity is almost carried out. The only difference is that the Ministry of Home Affairs does not control the services in these two Ministries. Then Sir questions were raised about backward areas and the backward States and also about the city of Calcutta. If the Budget is properly scrutinised it would be found that assistance is provided for the States particularly the backward States and the Finance Commission which assesses the overall requirements of the States takes this into consideration and makes its recommendations which are carried out every time the Finance Commission’s recommendations are received and they are received periodically according to the Constitution. Sir I would like to give the total amount paid to the States on this account. The main objective of planning is to create conditions in which living standards are raised in a sufficiently reasonable level and all citizens are given full and equal opportunity for growth and service. The plans seek to provide a balanced emphasis on increase in production and employment. The development plans are thus accepted as the means for ensuring equitable development in the field of social services. There is no reason to suppose that the needs of the less fortunate or prosperous States are being neglected. But it would not be proper to expect that all these differences could be wiped out now immediately. It must be seen whether we are going towards that very end or not. We are deliberately going towards that end and we hope and trust that in course of time these inequalities would be wiped out if not completely wiped out at any rate they would be lessened. My hon’ble friend complained about inadequate provision included in the plan for meeting the growing requirements of the city of Calcutta where even the basic services like water supply sewage disposal and drainage were not being augmented and that the Central Government was not enthusiastic about solving these difficulties.",
12: "I have no intention of giving a certificate about which my hon’ble friend Dr. Krishnaswami was talking some time ago since anything like a certificate being given by any Member of the business community is likely to be misunderstood. But the fact remains that impartial observers both here and abroad have testified to the soundness and stability of our finances which have successfully withstood severe stresses and strains of the changing economic factors both national and international and for this the fullest possible credit is due to the wise handling of the situation by our present Finance Minister. There have been criticisms on both sides. Some have described the Budget as pro-big business as something which has brought about a boom in the stock exchange and as something which has brought about satisfaction in the business circles. The fact is that if there has been any satisfaction it has been due purely to negative features of the budget and not because any positive relief in any direction has been given to business or industry. It is true that there were certain fears in the minds of the business community that in view of the expanding and growing needs of the Centre the Finance Minister might resort to certain further additional taxation and since those fears were not realised there has been some slight recovery in certain stock exchanges but that does not in the least mean that whatever relief and legitimate relief was due to the business and industrial community has received any adequate response from the Finance Minister. We have got to face the fact that we are at present engaged in the process of development. People who talk about U.K. and U.S.A conveniently forget that these are the most highly industrialised countries in the world and our taxation system so long as we are engaged in expanding and building our economy must be adjusted and linked with the requirements of the expanding economy and should not be compared with the high taxation levels that may be prevalent in U.K. and U.S.A. Friends have talked about unemployment. But whether the raising of the direct taxation levels will in any way mitigate unemployment is a question that should be considered. If the Finance Minister gives substantial relief in direct taxation I think that might lead to an acceleration in the pace of development. So it has to be considered whether it is relief in taxation which will lead to a reduction of unemployment or whether it is raising of taxation to the utmost levels which will dry up the resources and channels of capital formation and thereby not only retard all further development but might also throw the functioning of present industries out of gear. So my submission is that when the Taxation Enquiry Committee has been appointed it is only logical to expect that no substantial changes in the taxation structure will be made until the findings of that Expert Committee are known until we know the incidence of taxation in the various sectors of our economy. Now coming to the question of deficit financing I am afraid that my esteemed friend’s attitude was somewhat different from the line of opinion in the business and industrial community. Not that we advocate deficit financing bringing any artificial rise in prices but the fact is that those who have criticised deficit financing have not suggested any other alternative or made any other constructive suggestion which will bring about necessary development plans. After all the fact has got to be faced that whatever programme we have set out in the National Plan should go on unimpeded by any financial considerations. An assurance has been given by the Finance Minister that so far as financial resources are concerned he will ensure that the Five Year Plan will not in any way be retarded. In this connection I can only say that deficit financing is one thing so far as normal expenses and expenditure are concerned. Certainly nobody would advocate deficit financing which might be very undesirable. But when it is a question of doing something abnormal of investing something in productive channels then certainly some risk has got to be taken and I think the Finance Minister has been fully cautious in taking whatever measures he has so far. We know the measures that the Government took for contracting money supply about the end of 1950 and certain other measures adopted which brought about a slump. Also from time to time the Finance Minister did not hesitate to mop up the surplus which as the records would show has been about Rs. 300 crores during the past four or five years.",
13: "In the course of the debate yesterday on the Home Ministry’s Demands a number of points were raised by hon’ble Members. In particular I am happy that some Members of this House appreciated the efforts that were being made by the State Governments as also by the Centre so far as the various subjects under discussion were concerned especially so far as the law and order situation was concerned it was very good on the part of some Members to have appreciated the efforts made by the State Governments in this regard. There were a number of other points also which were raised and in respect of some of them I should like to enlighten the House so far as the real position is concerned. These points deal very briefly with Tripura the Andamans Delhi and Gujarat and they have also some bearing on the question of the Scheduled Castes the Scheduled Tribes and the Services. These therefore are the various points and I should like to place the correct picture before this House so that the House will know what Government have been doing so far as all these questions are concerned. With your permission I would deal briefly with Tripura first. When the Part C States Act was passed in view of a number of circumstances the geographical position of the State the backward nature of the State the existence of a very large number of tribal people and a number of other circumstances it was considered advisable so far as the administration of this State was concerned that it ought to be directly under the Government of India so that they can spend more for the purpose of developing this backward area. Now the question is often raised why we are not immediately introducing popular government in this tiny state the population of which is half a million. That question cannot be considered singly but will be considered in the context of the Report that we are receiving very shortly in the course of the next three or four months from the States Reorganisation Commission. The whole question will be considered. Their recommendations will be placed before the House and only then Government will take appropriate action. So far as the present regime is concerned it will also be kindly noted that it is not an autocratic rule in the popularly accepted sense of the term. Therefore I am pointing out to this House certain circumstances from which the House will gather that Government have been trying their best to improve the conditions there and to develop it to the extent that is possible. I would make a very brief reference to the expenditure during the last three years. For the year 1950-51 Government spent Rs. 95 lakhs. There is a considerable Scheduled Tribes population as also a Scheduled Castes population. Mostly they have come from Bangladesh. A sum of Rs. 17 lakhs has been set apart for the purpose of improving the condition of the Scheduled Castes as also the Scheduled Tribes. Then very great efforts are being made for the purpose of rehabilitating the refugees most of whom are from the Scheduled Castes and it will be found that as a matter of fact 190000 people have been rehabilitated in this tiny State of Tripura. Out of them 99000 and odd have been rehabilitated in Government colonies and land loans have been given facilities for education have been given and in respect of medical facilities it will be found that the amount has increased by at least five times. Then a point was made that unemployment was rising. So far as the question of unemployment is concerned it is a general question and has only a very short specific point so far as the State is concerned. You will find that in view of the development projects that Government have undertaken the number of persons employed or the service personnel in this tiny State has increased. These persons are actually under employment in respect of the different departments so far as development projects are concerned. Then you will also note that for the purpose of providing good buildings for offices especially for schools and hospitals the Government have a proposal before them which is being implemented according to which Rs. 1 crore are going to be spent for the purpose of construction of various buildings. Then we are also taking care to see that crime is not increasing at all. Very vague statements were made that crime was increasing. In fact so far as the border area is concerned there were only two dacoities and no more. Even all the offenders in respect of these offences have been brought under control.",
14: "Sir Now I would like to say something about tea. This time there is taxation on common tea the tea that we are consuming here so that there can be more earnings through export. But if we examine this tea industry we will find that we are not getting good results either by the efforts of the Tea Board or by the efforts of Government. One-fourth of the production of the whole country is represented by tea but that much of attention is not given by the Government to this industry. They think that it is already getting foreign earning and so it should continue to get it. But efforts should be made not only to develop this industry but also to improve the industry through research and other things. As you know in some parts the foreign companies which are working here are neglecting this industry. They are only after the profits they are not thinking of the development of the industry. There is room for development in many respects but it all depends upon research work and research stations should be set up wherever there is neglect. No doubt the Tea Board is there but the Tea Board is not seeing to these things. That is our complaint. In the Tea Board people are there who are not at all eager to see how this industry could be developed how we could earn more profits how the quality could be improved and how the quantity could be increased. We are not seeing to that. I come from a part where the tea industry plays an important part in the economy of that area. But I find that it is being neglected from year to year and no attention is given to it. I find that there is this drought menace in the tea plantations. As a result no further improvement in plantation is made. There the development of tea can be undertaken. I only suggest this to our Finance Minister. When you are giving relief to coffee why are you not giving relief to tea which is earning much more foreign exchange? I humbly urge our Finance Minister to see to it and remove this burden on common tea. Now I would like to say a word about betelnut. There is taxation on betelnut which is imported. In my part large quantities of betelnuts are being smuggled. So there was a representation from that area saying that betelnut should also come within the purview of customs duty and that part should be declared a port. A representation was made to the Finance Ministry as also the Commerce and Industry Ministry but nothing is done. I urge upon them to see to this whether smuggling which is giving no benefit to the Government and which is going to be increased cannot be stopped. Though our land customs department is there it cannot deal with smuggling effectively. Smuggling is going on. So if you want to stop it some definite steps should be taken and the representation which was made from that part should be given due consideration. Now some other friend also touched upon rural economy and cottage and village industries. One thing we must do. That is we must remove the disparity between the town and the village. If we are to remove it what should be done? We should develop small industries village industries and cottage industries. How can they be developed? For that power should be there. Now my hon’ble friend was saying that out of six lakhs of villages only 19000 villages have been electrified. This is meagre. If village electrification is not given due consideration we cannot make progress. When our Draft Five Year Plan was discussed among Members of Parliament I asked for information about how much of village electrification was contemplated in the Third Five Year Plan. The answer was very unsatisfactory. Unless you develop your village industries how can you advance? They are also contemplating to employ the surplus labour and also agricultural peasants who are not wholly employed to develop village industries and to make a plan. But unless power is supplied unless you have a good scheme of rural electrification how can village industries be developed in these modern days? We say big things. We say here and we shout from housetops that so much is being done for the rural areas. But actually we are not doing what should be done. If rural electrification is there then rural industries can be developed. Otherwise they cannot be developed. Unemployment cannot be solved. The only solution for unemployment is the development of small industries and cottage industries. Otherwise unemployment will increase year by year and there will be frustration among young men particularly among the educated.",
15: "Sir before the House adjourned for lunch yesterday I had started speaking on the Essential Commodities Amendment Bill. I have got here with me the Bill as introduced. In the Statement of Objects and Reasons the Government pointed out that in certain cases it might be necessary for them not to award punishment prescribed in the law as it exists at present but to forfeit a part of the deposit. This relates to minor offences under the Essential Commodities Act. I can quite understand this and generally therefore nobody would oppose this thing but the question that I wish to raise in this connection before the House is the manner in which this Act is being implemented by the Government and also by the State Governments because here is a measure which is sponsored by the Ministry of Food and Agriculture and in regard to many aspects of which I believe the Central Government has concurrent jurisdiction but much is left to the States. Our experience has been especially in the State from which I come namely West Bengal that this Act is not implemented properly by the State authorities because of various connections of certain people high up with the big business and others indulging in speculation hoarding and so on. The result has been that whatever should be done had not been done. The Central Government has got powers under this Act to make rules to give directions to the States and to supervise the manner in which the particular measure is administered by the States. We found that much that should have been done was not done. What is the use of talking about the punishment of the small fry? Certainly if they are guilty they have to be punished and the smaller the fry the minor should be the punishment. I agree there but the point is that the Act is not properly implemented. We should like to know from the Government as to how many cases have been started under the Essential Commodities Act. We know that foodgrains had been hoarded speculation had been indulged in stocks had been removed from one State to another surreptitiously by unfair and illegal methods. These should have attracted the attention of the Essential Commodities Act. The Act was passed in this Parliament with a view to putting a check on speculative rise in prices. When it came to the question of practical implementation of this measure we found that the Government had failed. Now Government should say something about it. When Government seeks to amend an Act it should tell us as to how the parent Act which is proposed to be amended has been implemented. Is it the contention of the Government that difficulty arises because this particular provision is not there in the Act? Are Government in trouble because they do not know how to deal with the smaller fries? Or is it because that those who are supposed to administer this measure at the State level at the district level have thought it fit to ignore it have thought it fit to by-pass it? If any measure of the Central Government was needed for controlling the price of foodgrains and ensuring the supply of essential commodities to the community it is the Essential Commodities Act. I would like the Minister to say something on this. I know that he was not here at the time when we passed this measure nor was he there when the Essential Commodities Act was by-passed by many State Governments. In the past we had drawn the attention of the Minister to this problem and that Minister is now happily going to be the President of the Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee but there I would like to ask the Minister who has stepped into his shoes as to what he is doing in order to see to the proper implementation of this Act. How many prosecutions have taken place? The small people of course should be dealt with very mildly I agree and I support the measure but taking the law as it is today without this amendment it empowers Government to deal very effectively so far as the provisions of the law go with the big traders wholesalers and profiteers. I would like to know as to how they have dealt with them. How many are in jail today? How many have paid fine? How many have suffered imprisonment? How many licences have been cancelled as a result of malpractices corruption profiteering and so on all of which are provided for under this Bill? We are entitled to know. Take us into your confidence in regard to this matter. I say from whatever knowledge we have that very few have been prosecuted under this Act. If it is so it is not because our blackmarket trade has suddenly become whitemarket trade or those impious people have suddenly become virtuous with the succession in the office of the Food Minister by a new man.",
16: "The next question that I would like to deal with is the paragraph in the President’s Address relating to the progress made in our economy in our agricultural sector in our industrial sector in our foreign trade etc. Sir you were pleased to read out to us a very large list of the achievements of the Congress Government during the last decade and the important targets which have been achieved during the last ten years of our planned economy. You also mentioned the question of increase in food production increase in the production of agricultural commodities etc. Fortunately Sir here we have in our midst the ex-Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission Shri V.T. Krishnamachari who has addressed a number of meetings and seminars in New Delhi recently drawing our attention to the weakness in our agricultural sector. If the press reports are correct in one seminar he mentioned that even if all the targets of the Third Five Year Plan are achieved still at the end of the Third Five Year Plan period we may be facing a serious situation regarding the supply of agricultural commodities. He has also expressed the hope that we will be able to exceed the targets which have been fixed for the Third Five Year Plan. I do not know whether his expectation of exceeding the targets will be fulfilled or not but it is quite clear that we have not been able to give sufficient attention to the development of the agricultural sector. It has also been stated that development of the agricultural sector is one of the most difficult tasks tasks which have been found difficult both by democratic countries as well as by countries in which total planning is going on. It is all the more reason therefore that we should pay more attention to the agricultural sector so that it may be possible for us to meet our requirements as and when they arise and the situation which he has foreseen at the end of the Third Five Year Plan may not materialise. It is no use merely taking refuge behind some of the figures which have been complied and narrating the progress which has already been achieved. We are happy that some progress has been achieved but we are anxious that more progress should be there and for that purpose also certain definite steps will be taken. In this connection I am also happy to hear what the Defence Minister said yesterday in one of his public meetings namely that the Government of India is contemplating to create a set-up in our villages wherein our panchayats will be functioning more or less on the lines of Parliament. Unfortunately he did not elaborate that point further and the press has not thrown any more light on what that exactly means. But if it means that the panchayats will be in charge of the resources that are available in the villages that they will be in a position to determine how best the productive efforts in the villages are to be directed and in what direction determine what targets are to be achieved and when the production is there and there is a surplus to be exchanged with other centres in the country that the panchayats will have their say in the matter on what terms this surplus will be exchanged with other centres in the country then I think a very valuable step forward in the direction of building our economy on a decentralised basis will have been taken. We have always taken the view Sir that if planning is to succeed in our country and if there is not going to be any regimentation of our productive activity and forces what is necessary is that the common man should have a voice in determining the economic policies and in formulating the economic plans of development and should have also his say in determining on what terms a village or a group or an industry should be working for the development of economy as a whole. In other words some amount of competition some amount of bargaining power is to be generated in the lowest strata of our society and in the lowest rung of our economy so that with the help of that bargaining power under the overall influence and policy of the Planning Commission it may be possible for us to develop our economy in a manner which satisfies both the interests and the requirements of the nation as well as the aspirations of the people. When people feel that they also have their say in the formulation of policies and programmes and that such policies and programmes are not something which is dictated from New Delhi but are those which have been worked out by their own efforts and as a result of their own deliberations to that extent these plans are a part of their efforts in the development of their regions of their own crafts their own industries and their own skills.",
17: "Mr. Vice Chairman I rise to associate myself fully with the Resolution and the concern which has been expressed from all the various sections of the House regarding the urgent necessity of developing rural industries. As time passes by we are reaching a situation in our rural areas where something desperate needs to be done immediately if we want to preserve the social stability of the country and also to see that full use is made of the time and talent of the people in the rural areas which go waste today as has been pointed out in the Resolution. Sir the Planning Commission and the Government of India have applied their minds to the various isolated aspects of rural industries and some valuable reports have been published and some important recommendations have been made in these reports which need consideration. But unfortunately there is no high level decision regarding the various issues which face the country as far as the problem of rural industrialisation is concerned. We are not quite clear as to what first of all rural industries mean and what rural industrialisation implies. Does rural industrialisation mean the utilisation of local resources in order to meet the local needs? Or does rural industrialisation imply the creating of surplus in the rural areas which could be exchanged with the surplus in other centres of the country and thereby to create a richer life for the rural areas? Various opinions have been expressed with regard to this problem but there is no authoritative determination of the policy regarding the meaning of rural industrialisation. It has been suggested that if such import of capital and skill from urban centres were to mean merely the multiplication of industrial centres in the rural areas such an industrialisation of the rural areas would nullify the advantages that are likely to accrue as a result of the rural industrialisation. The time has come when some decision has to be taken as to what we really mean by this rural industrialisation. There is also difference of opinion regarding the authority that should undertake the responsibility for this rural industrialisation. From the literature that has been published in this connection it is quite obvious that two distinct and powerful schools have developed regarding this issue. On the one hand there are people who believe that the task of rural industrialisation should be entrusted to the village panchayats. Since they represent the village people and they have the resources and the powers to raise the necessary resources from the rural areas the panchayats it is felt are the competent authorities to deal with the problem of rural industrialisation. Equally strongly it has been argued by others that cooperatives are the right answer to the question as to which should be the authority that should deal with rural industrialisation. I may also mention that there is a third school which believes that the import of private capital and private skill into the work of rural industrial development is the real answer to the problem which we face in the matter of rural industrialisation. Here again some authoritative determination of the policy has become necessary because in the absence of such a policy ad hoc decisions are taken which sometimes cancel each other and therefore the rapid progress which we hope and wish for in rural industrialisation becomes impossible. Then again there is the further question of protection that may be necessary for rural industries in view of the lack of the internal economy from which rural industries would suffer whatever may be the answer to the first two questions. Prof. Malkani has already referred to this question and various suggestions have been put forward. But all these suggestions require some detailed consideration as there are a large number of difficulties in implementing any one of these suggestions. Demarcation of markets and the imposition of taxes in order to see that goods from the urban centres do not reach the rural centres in unfairly competitive conditions are some of the suggestions that have been made. One great advantage of a vast country is the large number of markets that are available for the goods that are produced in the country. However if these markets are artificially restricted and goods are not allowed to move from one centre to another I am afraid more problems would be raised than solved if this protection is sought to be given in this manner. Yet protection has to be given to the rural industries if these rural industries are to develop. Therefore serious and competent thinking is necessary in this connection and again time is running fast. Therefore it is desirable that we should have some authority which could examine the various issues involved and determine the policy with regard to this matter also.",
18: "Mr. Vice Chairman I wish the matter had not come up for discussion in this House in the form in which it has come because we will be discussing it appears the same subject more or less piecemeal in connection with the other two Bills as well. What was necessary for the Government in this connection was to provide for a general discussion on the report of the Finance Commission the kind of thing that we have on such reports and after hearing the views of the Members here they should have formulated a Bill. Even if they had formulated the Bill earlier the Bill should have been preceded by a discussion on the report. It would then have given us an opportunity of dealing with this rather important subject in our public finance and indeed in our national life. But now we are asked to treat this matter piecemeal and deal with the Bill as it comes separately. I say Sir this would not seem very fair. It is true that we have had two other Reports of the Finance Commission and that we have had certain opportunities of discussing the issues raised by the Finance Commission on previous occasions. But that should not have precluded a thorough discussion of the Third Report more especially after the experience of the two five year plans and generally also after the experience of the States in the matter of public finance and as regards relations between the States and the Centre. All I can say is that the Government does not understand the magnitude of the problem or the urgency or the seriousness of the issues involved. It is possibly because they think that all the State Governments are under their control and that the State Governments would toe the line whatever is laid down from here. Suppose Sir today a number of States had been outside the control of the same party which controls the Central Government problems would have become acute because conflicts between the State Governments controlled by certain other parties and those controlled by the Congress Party which controls the Central Government would have arisen sharply calling for a thorough discussion and mutual consultation in a different way. Once they can get passed whatever they like and also once it is passed the States will more or less accept without any protest the dispensation of the Centre. Now that the Bill is before us we have to speak on this subject rather on the general themes. Yet I would like to make certain general observations in this connection because the basis of the Bill is the Report of the Third Finance Commission. This is a long standing issue facing the public finance of the country. Those who have studied Economics will know well how this matter had come up even during the British time when we did not have either independence or any kind of autonomy in the States even in that set-up. Even at that time the State Governments functioning under the British felt that something should be done with regard to the relations between the Centre and the States. There had been a long-standing controversy as to how the taxes especially the income-tax should be divided between the Centre and the States. I do not deny the existence of the controversy and this controversy is not easy to resolve. I entirely agree. But I should have thought that the Third Finance Commission should be tried to face the problems before it not more or less in a routine manner but in the context of the new things not only as they are today but as they are going to shape in the coming future. We have got what is called a quasi-federal Constitution. I do not say federal Constitution although the spirit is there but a Quasi-Federal Constitution because most of the powers many of the powers that should remain with the States are now in the hands of the Central Government. Therefore in that way it is more Unitary in character than federal. At the same time structurally speaking we have got the State Assemblies Legislatures State Budgets and so on. They function more or less in the same way. But if you go a little deeper into the affairs it would immediately lead you to think that the States do not have any substantial real power especially in the matter of finance. Perhaps at the time when the Constitution was framed this aspect did not figure very much in the minds of the makers of the Constitution. We had just become free and the concept of welding India into a solid nation was uppermost in the minds of those people who framed the Constitution and all others as well. In that background it was quite understandable that it should be the dominant thought as to how to put the put the different segments of our country into a whole namely the Indian Union.",
19: "Sir I would like to make a few observations so that the hon’ble Minister will make a note about the way in which these institutions are being run. It is a good thing that these institutions have been started. But at the same time we are suffering from lack of co-ordination in regard to our technical education. We have certain institutes like the polytechnic etc under the Scientific Research and Cultural Affairs Ministry and they are run through the State Governments. Then there are the engineering colleges under the universities and thirdly Sir trade technical education is imparted by the Central Labour Ministry at the State level. In addition to that the States have certain arrangements of their own for technical education. I feel that there is no effort at co-ordination and that leads to a good deal of confusion. Perhaps if there is effort there are certain difficulties. I hope the hon’ble Minister will tell us about that. I would also like to suggest that even in these four institutions as for some time the medium of instruction would be English for emotional integration an attempt should be made to take a few students from the neighbouring region or other regions on a reciprocal basis. Otherwise these institutes will themselves be developing as was hinted by the previous speaker some regional consciousness. There is great difficulty Sir with regard to technical personnel for teaching and I am not aware in what way these institutes will be staffed. Perhaps some foreigners will be brought in but at the same time with the arrangements existing at present for taking technical help from different countries – Russia U.K. U.S.A. and Germany I do not know whether there will be special courses provided in these Institutes. For the teaching staff from those different countries what arrangements there are one does not know. In the present arrangement for teaching I should have liked to mention the fifth arrangement for teaching at present provided through the various industrial concerns like Bhilai Rourkela etc. All these big concerns have their big technical schools and they take their students for post-graduate work as also for research work. What will therefore happen with regard to the standard is a question. Sir we are not at all sure in our country about the correct use of terms. I would for instance mention here the word ‘polytechnic’. They have one school and even if there is arrangement for starting another subject no effort is made and no sooner they feel they should give out proper enquiries with regard to the possibilities for employment and the various mineral resources etc. and the basic education that should enable the students to enter the polytechnics to have the training where it is available these polytechnics are started. Similarly there is some confusion about the use of the word ‘university’. We have the Roorkee University for one subject i.e. engineering. So it seems there is going to be one university for one faculty. We have one music university also in Madhya Pradesh. We are going to start I am told perhaps a university only for agriculture. So if these institutes are there which term seems to be really the appropriate word in place of these one-faculty universities I think the hon’ble Minister should take the initiative in determining what should be the exact connotation of these terms. Otherwise one day as was pointed out there will be perfect confusion. There comes also the question of the recognition of the degree given by these Institutes. Of course if the training with the special facilities available and the specially recruited staff available is of a high standard naturally people who have passed out from there. In the beginning there will not be any trouble with regard to making use of the graduates turned out from there. But the question of recognition has to be decided on certain principles and those principles should be laid down and followed from the beginning. Now I would like also to mention the question about scholarships. It was pointed out that certain scholarships especially to the children of the working class should be given. I would like to point out here that there is already provision for that and it is not something new. What I would like to stress is that scholarships should be in larger numbers. The scholarships do not seem to be adequate for the rising standard of living and the cost of living. The scholarships that are given do not meet half the need. There is yet another matter which the hon’ble Minister is the proper person to enquire about and that is the merit scholarships that are available in different States to students for technical subjects or to other students who pass with very high marks are not given by the States if they read outside the State.",
20: "Mr. Deputy Chairman Sir I extend to this resolution my whole-hearted support though I wish he had extended its scope by incorporating within it two more services but then I cannot deal with that subject now. You have assured me that the matter will be taken up on a subsequent occasion. I do not know when that subsequent occasion is likely to occur. Sir I am grateful to the Home Minister for some kind words he has said about me in regard to my interest in this subject. No doubt for long I have been urging the necessity of creating more all-India Services. During the last five years or so ever since that recommendation on the subject was made by the States Reorganisation Commission and during the last one year and a half near about that time I have been tabling Resolutions on the subject twice or thrice but they could not come up. Of course as they say there are higher forces that govern the destiny of things and so far as Parliament is concerned it is the Government and the undisputed sway of the Chair that govern the density of Resolutions. Obviously it was so ordained that this Resolution should come up only now and that too as a Government-sponsored Resolution. Even as it is I welcome it most heartily and feel enthusiastic and even jubilant about it. Sir I sincerely congratulate the hon’ble the Home Minister for the tact the firmness the strength and the determination which he has shown in overcoming all the delicacies and difficulties which I am sure were there in his way. The opposition and unwillingness of the States were there initially I know. And I also know Sir that about a year ago when I tabled a question on this subject the then Home Minister told us that the Government would be only too glad to have more all-India Services but then the handicap in their way was that the States were not agreeable to it. Subsequent to that Sir about the middle of this year I wrote to all the Chief Ministers requesting them to let me know their views on this subject and I was a little unhappy to find that no Chief Minister replied to me saying that he was agreeable to it. One or two of them especially said that they were against it. So all these difficulties were there in the way of the Home Minister. But I find that by his sweet persuasion he has been able to win over all the Chief Ministers who in the conference immediately preceding the last one agreed to it in principle and in the subsequent conference they agreed to it it appears obviously in toto and hence we have before us this Resolution supported by the Chief Ministers of all the States. Sir for that I want to congratulate most sincerely and heartily the hon’ble the Home Minister. Now Sir so far as the merits of this Resolution are concerned. I do not think it is necessary for me to elaborate on them because during the last four years or so ever since the publication of the Report of the States Reorganisation Commission many eminent men all over the country eminent administrators and persons who had experience of administration including the retired comptroller and Auditor General were of the opinion that more all-India Services should be created. Our Hon’ble the Prime Minister as also our Vice-President have on more than one occasion expressed themselves definitely in favour of having more all-India Services. Last year Sir about the month of October when addressing the Indian Police officers when they were going out after having had their training for a year he expressly said that if national integration was to be maintained it was necessary to have more all-India Services. That being so I think there is not much need for us to emphasise the necessity and the utility for having more all-India Services. Sir in the interest of efficiency and also in the interest of integrity it is absolutely necessary that we should have these three all-India Services as also some other. The major problem these days before us is that successful implementation of the development programmes has to be carried through. It is not enough that we should have big schemes. It is not enough that we should allocate large sums for the implementation of those schemes. But it is necessary that we should have competent personnel to effectively implement our schemes so that in a short time we may be able to carry forward our country to economic prosperity all around. In the past during the pre-Independence period we had quite a number of all-India Services but then when we framed our Constitution we dispensed with the others retaining only two. It appears to me that necessity has now arisen for reorganisation of the all-India Services and to have more all-India Services.",
21: "Now coming back to the question of minorities you will please find why this particular Resolution has been so widely put in that it might include a religious minority as well a linguistic minority as well or an economic minority as some hon’ble Members rightly pointed out. Now Sir a question arises whether there ought to be any such protection in so far as a particular type of minority is concerned. I shall deal with the question of minorities at some length. But you will please find Sir what the hon’ble mover wants is that there ought to be endowed with statutory powers. Therefore Sir an attempt is being made for the first time by my hon’ble friend for driving a wedge between a community and a community. So far as the Constitution is concerned as my hon’ble friend rightly pointed out whenever the question of minorities arises we have to be extremely careful. The Constitution is a very sacred document which has embodied all the different aspects of the common question of India’s nationality. India is one in spite of different types of languages and religions. But in the midst of all these diversities we have to develop a common nationality. Therefore whenever we consider the question of the development of the nation and the interest of the nation you cannot afford to think in terms either of religion or of language. It is true Sir that there are different religions. It is also true that there are different languages. Therefore a question arose and the framers of the Constitution had to devise a Constitution in the midst of the unity of India with certain diversities here and there. For that purpose what they did was they devised a common nationality for the whole of India and in so far as religious minorities were concerned they were given certain rights. I would not go into the details regarding the provisions of the Fundamental Rights regarding the practice of religion. Certain rights have been given to the religious minorities and beyond that it would not be proper to bring in the religious minorities for political rights. For that we have to be extremely careful. I would also point out that while we have to develop a common nationality the members of the Indian nation have to understand that we are one nation. Therefore certain rights in respect of religious minorities were given. They were Fundamental Rights and most of them are justiciable rights. Here we stopped so far as the religious rights were concerned. Then a question arose what ought to be the attitude of not only the Government but the society regarding the languages. It was true that there were certain interests of the regional languages. Now these languages required to be developed but they were not meant for dividing one man from the other. So in 1956 when the States were formed to a certain extent on the basis of language what was done was not to have a State with cent per cent people belonging to the regional language because there were bound to be people belonging to different languages. That was the reason why this question was considered at great length and the States Reorganisation Commission also went into this question of linguistic minorities. It was bound to arise here and there because they were likely to feel that their rights and safeguards given to them might or might not be properly implemented. So this question was considered first by the States Reorganisation Commission and they dealt with the question whether we should have a permanent Minorities Commission. They went into it very carefully and shrewdly. They found out that it would not be proper to set up a permanent Minorities commission because the result if not the actual effect would be that a permanent wedge would be driven between one community and another community. So far as language minorities were concerned they had a right so far as their own languages were concerned. They had also an obligation to understand the language of the majority in the particular State. It is only by thus coming together that the members of the two language groups would come together and would harmoniously develop but it was found at the time when the States Reorganisation Commission had to consider this that some machinery should be devised for safeguarding the rights of linguistic minorities only and after full consideration what was conceded was that only in respect of linguistic minorities certain rights should be extended and certain rights should be safeguarded and an officer should be appointed by the President for making a report on the question whether these rights of the linguistic minorities are or are not properly safeguarded.",
22: "Coming to the internal affairs of the country Madam Deputy Chairman the policies of the Government of India for the last fifteen years have been so manipulated that the rich people are becoming richer and the poorer sections of the people are becoming still poorer. The committee that has been appointed to investigate into the question of the distribution of income has not yet given its verdict but it is common knowledge that the people who are in the higher-ups have become more rich and the people in the lower rung have become poorer. The prices of essential commodities that the peasants and the workers use have gone up so high that they are not within the reach of the mass of the people of the country. Government have not taken adequate steps to bring down the prices and to stabilise the prices as was recommended by the Foodgrains Committee. We are now in the Third Plan. While the plans are progressing the number of the unemployed in the country is increasing. This is a very anomalous position. It is the Government alone that can explain why in spite of the Plans the unemployment problem is becoming more and more acute. As was rightly pointed out yesterday by some speakers our agriculture has not been paid due attention that should have been paid to in a country where 80 per cent of the people live on land. Some three of four years back when Mr. Ajit Prasad Jain was the Food and Agriculture Minister he was made to resign under shady circumstances as one who had proved not capable of solving the food problem in the country a suggestion was thrown that the portfolio of Agriculture should be handled by an important and senior Member of the Cabinet and particularly in the States by the Chief Ministers of the States. But nothing of the sort has happened. Whatever increase in foodgrains output we have obtained is not because of any increase in the yield per acre but because of extensive cultivation more land has been brought under cultivation and some irrigation facilities have now been provided. But the increase that we have seen is not in keeping with the demand that is necessary for us to feed 400 millions in India. So whatever industrial development we want the basic factor is that our agricultural economy should be improved. For that all efforts should be made more fertilisers should be used and new methods of cultivation should be employed for growing more food crops and for growing other cash crops. In a review that was published by the Planning Commission itself they have pointed out that there is acute shortage of power in more than 50 per cent of the States in India. We have accepted a planned economy we have completed two Plans and we are now in the Third Plan. I do not know why the Planning Commission or the planners concerned did not foresee this shortage of power in most of the States in India and why they did not plan generation of more power so that people will not accuse the State Governments or the Planning Commission that they did not work out the plans properly in order to have more industries and to have more foodgrains produced through lift irrigation. In most of the States- in Andhra in West Bengal in Bihar in Karnataka – power shortage whatever power is available now is being rationed. There are thousands of units of small scale industries which are not working for want of power and there are thousands of lift irrigation pumps which are denied power supply for purposes of irrigating their lands and wherever power is supplied it is during nights which is not very convenient to make use of the power and use the power for agricultural purposes. The Finance Minister in the statement that he made in the Lok Sabha and which was placed before us has stated that it was assessed that for the successful implementation of the Plan even after taking every possible measure for the development of our exports which clearly must be given the highest priority we would need external assistance of the order of Rs. 2600 crores and we have however been less successful in obtaining and utilising the external assistance required for financing the imports necessary for our developing economy. To industrialise our country and to bring it on par with other well developed countries we do need assistance – financial technical and other assistance. The Finance Minister was so hopeful that he was getting Rs. 2600 crores of foreign aid from Aid India Club and other countries. But now he is not hopeful of getting that amount which is necessary to fulfil the targets in the Third Five Year Plan.",
23: "Madam Deputy Chairman when the house rose for lunch I was discussing the response of the public to the loan programme of the Government and was trying to point out that it was rather a serious tendency in the sense that the response of the public had been proved to be poorer during the Tenth Plan period than during the Ninth Plan period. I was trying to point out that looking to the fact that the national income was rising and the people were becoming more conscious of a developing economy and the need to mobilise the resources more and more a contrary trend ought to have appeared and that in view of that this trend was disturbing. This trend is to be contrasted with the trend of the public regarding the call from the corporate sector for the investment of their moneys. Here we find that the shares of some of the new companies or of the old companies that are issuing new shares are over-subscribed at times to the extent of fifteen times the capital that has been asked for by the companies. So here are two pictures; one the picture of the Government asking the public to subscribe to the public loans and the other the picture of the response of the public to the corporate sector demanding investments form the public. While on the one hand there is an enthusiastic response to the demand from the corporate sector on the other there is a very poor response as far as the loan programme of the Government is concerned. This is a matter of some concern and I feel that the Government should pay more attention than just exhorting the people to save more and to hand over their savings to the Government as the hon’ble Finance Minister has done more than once. If it would have been merely a question of rediverting the money that is coming from the corporate sector to the public exchequer in the form of loans perhaps the matter would not have been so serious. Then it would have been just a question of re-allocation of the functions between the public sector and the private sector. But I feel that there is a large amount of money which is just changing to some lucrative channel and that explains why the response to the demand from the corporate sector is fifteen times. This shows that fourteen times that particular capital is not required by that company and if there had been some adequate step or measure whereby originally that money could have gone to the public exchequer to that extent there would not have been any disappointment to the people who wanted shares but who did not get them and disappointment to the public exchequer by not getting the response which it ought to have got. That to my mind leads to the question of the pattern of the rate of interest. In a developing economy and especially in view of the fact that a large number of companies are being floated today which have got an element of growth in them thereby attracting so much capital towards them the Government of India will to take into consideration the question of the rate pattern of interest on their loans and to see whether something could not be done whereby the public will be attracted to a large extent towards their loan programme that Hitherto. It has appeared in the press that the question of supply and want is being reconsidered and that offers are sought to be made more attractive. If in the same strain the entire question of the loan programme is also considered it may be possible that these loans also might be made more attractive and thereby more capital which is today just changing the channels of profitable employment might be diverted to the public exchequer in the form of public loan. Then there is the question of the State Governments performing their part which has been assigned to them during the Eleventh Plan period. In this connection I would like to draw the attention of the hon’ble House to a very important recommendation which has been made by the Eleventh Finance Commission namely the appointment of a high-power commission to go into the entire question of the allocation of financial resources between the Central Government and the State Governments. They have argued the whole case in nearly one and a half pages in order to show why it has now become necessary that a high-power commission should be appointed to go into this important question. According to the Third Finance Commission the allocation of resources between the centre and the states was made at a time when planned economic development was not visualised. When the constitution was framed the development of the public sector the new responsibilities which the states were going to assume and a Plan era were not properly visualised and it was under these conditions that these allocations were being made.",
24: "Madam Deputy Chairman I rise to support the Bill which has been moved by the hon’ble Minister of State in the Ministry of Home Affairs. This Bill incorporates certain sentiments which the country holds so dear as far as the office of President is concerned and also incorporates the faith of the people in themselves that when they will elect a President the person who would be occupying the high post would be a person who would have not only the love and affection of the people but would be as the hon’ble Minister pointed out a dedicated politician whose whole life is dedicated to the service of the nation before he became the President during his occupation of the President and even after he retired from that office. It is this confidence of the people in themselves and the high love and affection which they hold for this office which have resulted in this particular bill being considered by the House at the present moment. The hon’ble Minister has pointed out that the President who has just retired has fulfilled all the requirements which are the basis of this particular measure and the measure which was passed in 2001. I wish that he had mentioned the last Governor General also to whom both the measures apply. Whether we may agree or may not agree with the last Governor-General on some of the political views that the holds there can be no two opinions that the last Governor- General was also an illustrious son and is an illustrious son of this country and deserves all the consideration all the love and all respect of the country which are being incorporated in the present measure and were incorporated in the 2001 Act. While therefore fully supporting the measure which is now before the House I would like certain clarifications regarding the rules that are going to be made for giving effect to the provisions which have been incorporated in the present Bil. In the Statement of Objects and Reasons we are told that a person holding the high office of President has even after retirement many public calls on him and it is therefore considered desirable to provide him with secretarial staff. It is further stated that the bill provides for a staff which may be engaged for the President. Staff might be appointed for him and office space might be provided for him. It is because of this that certain misgivings have arisen in the minds of some of the members and they want it to be made perfectly clear that the staff will be appointed by the ex-President and it will be his wishes and his desires that will be taken into account when a particular person is being appointed. Also regarding the office which is engaged for him his wishes should be taken into account so that he knows what would be a convenient place for him and he may try to get that place. Another reason for insisting on what I consider to be an important detail is that if the Government appoints the staff for the ex-President then automatically they become Government servants because they have been appointed by the Government. It may be that in the rules a clarification might be attempted whereby they may be exempted from some of the Service Conduct Rules which are applicable to normal Government Servants. But even there it will be much better that this should not be left in any doubt and that these persons that are appointed to assist the ex-President in this secretarial task are appointed by the ex-President himself. They would be the staff of the ex-President and would not be appointed by the Government for the ex-President and would not be Government servants. This point ought to be made quite clear so that the ex-President has got all the right of determining the service conditions of the people appointed by him of course subject to the overall limit which has been provided and to my mind rightly provided in the bill. Within that overall limit perhaps it will be much better to leave the rest of the matter to the president himself so that we may also express our further confidence in the President to the effect that he would utilise it with discretion and with all sense of responsibility and fairplay and taking into account the interests of the public and of the public exchequer too. Another point which also needs some clarification is regarding the payment to be made for the secretarial assistance and for the secretarial staff. Normally Government rules required that whenever any such demand is made on the public exchequer or on the Consolidated Fund of India a certain formality has to be gone through and that formality of accounting has to be in a prescribed form.",
25: "Mr. Vice-Chairman first of all I must place of record my grateful thanks to the University Grants Commission for the work that they have done for the advancement of higher education. They have done good work and in full co-operation with the Education Ministry. This I think must encourage State Governments to establish university grants commissions or committees in their respective states. What the country needs most is the coordinated efforts of the autonomous university grants commissions working in harmony with the State Governments and university authorities. Coordinated efforts are needed to bring about certain uniformity in the standards of university education. Without that our educational advancement is bound to suffer from various tensions and difficulties. I do agree with my friend that the Annual Report under discussion is rather a dull report. At least it is not as bright as the two previous Reports were. In the previous two reports the University Grants Commission invited the attention of the nation to certain educational needs. Unfortunately in this Report the University Grants Commission confines its remarks mostly to what has been achieved in the field of university education under the guidance and with the assistance of the University Grants Commission. However Sir It is not possible for me to agree with Mr. Santhanam that the University Grants Commission should not extend help to universities for the preservation of manuscripts. Manuscripts are of great importance so far as university libraries are concerned. It is the duty of universities to preserve those manuscripts and it is the duty of the University Grants Commission to extend to universities the necessary financial assistance for maintaining and preserving manuscripts in good order. Also it is not possible for me Sir to agree with my friend that today universities are enjoying too much of autonomy. I agree with the University Grants Commission which two years ago remarked that freedom is vital for education and democracy and I personally feel Sir that on one plea or the other university autonomy and academic freedom are being restricted rather than being extended as they must be. I do not think Sir that a social purpose or a social value can be imparted in the teaching by a teacher through the imposition of restrictions on his freedom of thinking. I feel that teachers need academic freedom for discharging their duties in an efficient way. If we take into consideration the affiliated colleges we will notice that the teachers are subjected to such humiliating conditions that it is not possible for them to discharge their duties to their students to impart to their students any sense of responsibility or any moral values in their lives. I therefore Sir feel that it is necessary to be more careful about the preservation of academic freedom to teachers. Sir we are grateful to the Education Ministry and to the University Grants Commission for upgrading the salaries of teachers in the Central universities. Yet a great disparity prevails in the salaries of teachers of Central Universities and State Universities and affiliated colleges and this disparity is causing a lot of heart-burning and a lot of difficulties. As one connected with education I may say that there is not such a marked difference in the quality of teachers serving in the Central Universities and in the State Universities and in affiliated colleges as to justify the great disparity in the salaries of teachers of these institutions. I feel Sir that we must keep in our mind the remarks of the University Grants Commission made in their earlier Annual Report with regard to teachers salaries. We are not only to provide adequate salaries to teachers of affiliated colleges but also to teachers of secondary schools. We must remember Sir that a great majority of students study in affiliated colleges and the quality of education is largely determined by the quality of work that is done in affiliated colleges. For important in the quality of teaching improvement in living conditions is also very necessary. The University Grants Commission has invited or attention in its Report to the appalling conditions in which teachers have to live. But unfortunately the University Grants Commission has to admit that it does not seem likely that we shall be make anything more than the marginal contribution towards this practical need. I feel that the University Grants Commission should pay more attention to the solution of this problem than has so far been paid by it and the Education Ministry and that the Government should not grudge funds to the University Grants Commission for making adequate arrangements for improving living conditions of teachers who are expected to train the citizens of the country. Sir in the University Grants Commission Report it is maintained that Rs. 12000 should be granted to every affiliated college for the welfare of the teaching staff and that efforts should be made to provide them with quarters and that too in the vicinity of the college where they teach.",
26: "Mr. Vice-Chairman I would now like to make a few observations on the Ministry of Education. Education is basic to any national Regeneration. It is true that it does not bring any return as our other projects do as for instance the steel projects or the irrigation projects do. But this is the investment that is designed to help building up of the human material. It is agreed that education has expanded after independence and during the plan periods. But it is a matter for concern that the content of education has not been equal to our expectations. Even today we are engaged in experimenting with all types of education from the basic stage up to the university level. It is not clear. I presume that the basic pattern of education of which so much was said and written is accepted as a success even today. Where do we stand with regard to the basic pattern? It seems to be the position that all arguments are in favour of that type of education but all proof is against the success of such a type of education. Where does the Government stand with regard to this type of education? We swore by the basic type of education because it was discovered by the Father of the Nation. But if it has been a failure why should not the Government say that that is the position? Then again take secondary education and also collegiate education. Three years ago it was said that all universities should have three year degree courses and some universities which were reluctant to accept this reform were more or less compelled to do so and they accepted it. Now certain universities find that this scheme is not working satisfactorily and they feel that they should have a two-year course in the college before students could enter the degree course. I mention this to show that this eternal tinkering with education should stop and it should not go on like this. This uncertainty is not only with regard to the main objective of education the main structure of education from the primary to the collegiate level but also with regard to the courses of studies and also with regard to the language or medium of instruction. Mr. Chairman up to the secondary stage it has been accepted that the medium of instruction should be the regional language. The National Integration Council however stated that if universities are to exchange professors if they have to develop freely then there should be the common medium of instruction namely English and Hindi. Now at the latest National Integration Council meeting we are told that the medium of instruction in the colleges should also be the regional language ultimately and if that comes to pass I ask how will national integration be achieved? It is permissible to envisage a stage if the scheme of the National Integration Council is implemented where different universities will have different media of instruction and the men that will be drawn from these universities will have to man the judiciary of the land and the all-India services. But they will not be able to serve in a State other than the one in which they were educated. How can integration be achieved? We are working at cross purposes. It is time that a high power body was appointed to hammer out a national scheme of education having integration as the basic aim and to implement it systematically. The present method of meddling at every stage of education the present climate in which we are not clear about the medium of instruction at different stages is causing concern to the parents to the pupils and weakening the country in the process. This is a major problem at this stage of the development of the country. Then Mr. Vice-Chairman I would pass on to the Ministry of Transport and Communications. According to this Ministry we are to build a system of National Highways provincial or State Highways an integrated system of communication form the village upwards but the Central Government is concerned with the construction of National Highways. It is good to have a fine system of National Highways. It also serves as a physical link for integrating the nation. It is good but this planning of construction of National Highways without regard to the development of railways and the development of industries in the regions in which the Highways are proposed to be constructed will be something beyond our means at the present moment. Assuming that we have a network of National Highways are they to be put to immediate use? Are they good investments? Unless you have industries small big or medium coming along the highways unless they assure you a fair return for the investment it is not desirable to have a system of Highways for the sake of mere transport of passengers. In other words we should have a scheme of priorities for the National Highways so that they can be looked after.",
27: "Mr. Vice Chairman Sir I rise to support the Plantations Labour (Amendment) Bill brought up by the Government for our consideration. Sir the sad plight of millions of toiling people who sweat on various plantations in the country to earn valuable foreign exchange for us in really too much to be expressed in words. These workers live and work in most inhuman and pitiable conditions. These plantations include tea coffee cinchona rubber etc. and as we know tea alone is one of the major foreign exchange earners of our country. But Sir it is indeed most regrettable that notwithstanding a lapse of 62 years since our Independence these workers who earn crores and crores of rupees by way of foreign exchange have to live in most miserable conditions. They live in houses that are most insecure and collapse frequently and when these workers die as a result of these collapses their guardians or their dependents do not get even due compensation for the loss that they have to bear. Unhygienic living in distant and far-flung areas compounded with lack of medical and educational facilities make their life utterly miserable. These Plantation workers have to live in abject poverty like slaves of their employers. And as we know most of these plantations are still foreign-owned establishments last vestiges of the colonial rule the British rule and as I said it is a matter of deep regret for all of us that despite enacting an Act the Plantations Labour Act 2001 we have not yet been able to effect any improvement in their condition. I think the employers alone are not responsible for their miserable condition. We are also as much responsible as they are because although we could enforce the enactment and we could improve their conditions much earlier we have failed in doing so. Sir on the 9th May 2003 this House the Rajya Sabha decided that a Joint Committee should be appointed to look into the desired amendment and put up a draft as early as possible for our consideration. On the 26th May 2003 the Lok Sabha also adopted our Resolution our motion with the result that a 45-Member committee in which 15 representatives were from the Rajya Sabha and 30 from the Lok Sabha was appointed to look into the matte. This Committee was to submit its report on the 1st day of the 15th Session of the Rajya Sabha that was in 2003. But this Committee had to be granted these extension and the report was ultimately available on the 3rd March 2005. At that time as we all know the so-called JP’s movement of total revolution was at its peak. Within two or three months the national emergency had to be declared and during the emergency priorities had changed and we could not just effect this desired improvement at that time and we could not bring about this legislation. And then the Janta rule and the Lok Dal rule. For 30 months they were in power but they too-although they try to pose to be the champions of the downtrodden and the workers-filed to deliver the goods and that is why today we are going to consider the report of that committee that was presented to the Government in 2005. Therefore we are also equally responsible for not ameliorating their conditions and their plight. The Committee had to consider 120 memoranda giving views and suggestions from various unions and associations and 59 witnesses appeared before the committee and that committee itself came to the conclusion that in various areas even the barest minimum facilities such as arrangement for supply of wholesome drinking water latrines urinals provision of qualified doctors had not been provided though these amenities are a must under the act. The Act has been there but we could not enforce it; we could not implement it only because the employers did not want it; they did not want to give to the workers due justice. Inadequacy of punishments that are awarded under the Act is one of the main impediments standing in the way of implementation of various welfare measures. Courts generally take a lenient view of the offences under the Act and they let off the employers who are offenders with light punishment which generally amounts to a fine of Rs.100. So the Committee suggested amendment to section 36 of the Act. An employer is required to provide these workers living accommodation but generally in spite of the fact that the Government gives loans and subsidies to the employers for construction of houses progress in regard to these constructions is very poor. As I said earlier very unhygienic and insecure houses are there where these people have to live. Even compensation to the workers in the event of house collapse is not given.",
28: "Mr. Vice-Chairman I was speaking about the need for developing a strong U.N. delegation. I wish that the hon’ble Prime Minister would give his attention to this aspect of the matter particularly in view of the fact that in the next decade or two politics all over the world would take on a complex character and it is necessary that men are trained from now on for taking part in international affairs. In the U.K. and the United States such delegations are built with men who have wide knowledge of international affairs and there should be other qualification for a man to be included in such a delegation. In this connection I should like to mention that it is time for Government to develop sound conventions regarding the conduct of foreign affairs. In the United States they have accepted the principle of bipartisan consultation on important affairs of policy. For example when President Kennedy stood for election President Eisenhower even during the period of the conduct of the campaign of President Kennedy kept him informed about major developments in foreign affairs. We have seen our Government sending troops out of this country to the Congo and at that time I had raised the point that before troops left our country for any assignments of an unusual character like the Congo assignment Members of the Opposition should be informally consulted. There will be no question of any leakage of information whatever if leaders in the Opposition are consulted on important aspects of foreign policy. The Consultative Committee of the External Affairs Ministry does go some way to meet the needs of exchanging information about foreign affairs but the informal consultation of the kind that I mention where the Leader of the Opposition and leaders of other Parties are called and told by the Prime Minister about unusual developments would strengthen the convention that the foreign policy of the country has the support not only of the Congress Party but also of the entire country. I was speaking about our external publicity and it is a subject on which I think I can speak with some confidence as I have been an old time newspaperman in this country. The material which is sent out to foreign countries is extremely scrappy and useless. There is included in these messages some statement of what this Minister was saying somewhere. We are trying to give publicity to ministerial activities and it is inevitable that some such publicity should be given because Ministers are in charge of the Government but one abroad does not get a real idea of what is happening in the country. I would like to suggest for the consideration of the External Affairs Ministry that they should send a fortnightly assessment of what is happening in India written dispassionately not to please a Minister or to highlight something that he has done but to give an objective assessment of what is going on in the country. In the old days when the British Government was in existence such fortnightly reports used to be sent by various State Governments and I think a beginning can be made in that direction in this matter. The other point I would like to suggest is that publicity is a complicated and technical matter. The Foreign Service as it is constituted today does not have sufficient training in publicity. The Estimates Committee which went into the demands of the External Affairs Ministry mentioned about the methods of training which have been adopted but since our Foreign Service men are not trained in publicity work and one sees for example that a lot of confusion has arisen in the United States over Ambassador Nehru’s statement I think the External Affairs Ministry might well set up a Committee of Members of Parliament who are conversant with external publicity and some newspapermen to advise the External Affairs Ministry from time to time. I do not think that the Committee will ask for information which is confidential or secret but they can assist the newspapermen. There are a handful of competent men who would be willing to serve on the Committee in an advisory capacity. They would be able to tell the External Affairs Ministry what should be done in order that our news publicity abroad is better. I might mention also that the Estimates Committee had recommended the creation of a cultural cell. Sir to my mind we have also to be clear in our mind regarding the objective of rural industrialization. Do we mean to have only diversification of rural economy and are we going to have rural industrialisation only in order to give some help to those who find themselves unemployed during a certain period of the year? Are we aiming at utilising local resources and meeting local needs through diversification of rural economy or have we a more fundamental objective in mind when we are trying to industrialise the rural areas? Without this I am afraid rural industrialization will not be possible.",
29: "If you scan the history of the railways in this country you will see that it was the Presidency towns- Bombay Madras and Calcutta- that determined the pattern of our railways as well as of our industrial and economic growth. The British when they landed in this country established trading centres called forts. In Chennai it was Fort St. George; in Kolkata it was Fort St. Williams and in Mumbai it was merely a Fort and there was one in Surat also. It is these trading establishments which determined the pattern of government the pattern of administration and every other pattern under the British regime. They constructed the railways they established the industries they located their armies with reference to these three Presidency towns. This idea of the Presidency towns determining the pattern of our social structure industrial advancement and the system of our railways still persists. That is the mental lag that is hampering the vision of the Planning Commission the Railway Board and the Railways Ministry. Sir once I happened to travel from London to Rome by train. Another time I had to travel from Moscow to Leningrad by train. Nowhere did I find on the continent of Europe lines of varying breadth. It is all a uniform gauge. So is it in Russia- it may be 6 ft. there. In America in every industrially advanced country you find that the gauge is uniform. This very country which ruled us namely the United Kingdom had inside its border a uniform gauge but they inflicted three systems of gauge on India. They thought that that would perpetuate what is called their domination or in the negative sense that it would impede the industrial and economic growth of India. Secondly it would make India always the customer and purchaser of lines and locomotives and rolling stock from the United Kingdom. In the old days I am told it is the Government which built the broad-guage line and it is the private companies that took to this metre gauge and narrow gauge. Though they may not have had the distinction of private and public sector in view then it now appears that what the so-called public sector then did has been good and what the private sector then did has been to our disadvantage. I would appeal to these agencies to introduce a uniform guage throughout India. In this connection it will be interesting to note the talk of the hon’ble Railway Minister about the schools primary schools higher secondary schools and high schools for the Indian Railways. If you examine the previous speech of the Railway Minister and also the working report of the Railway Board you will find that the same figure is repeated every year. I have examined the figures and I find that this year only 16 schools have been added out of which 13 are primary schools one is a higher secondary school and two are middle or high schools. Instead of saying that they have been able only to provide 13 primary schools or one or two more high schools or higher secondary schools the same figures are repeated in the speech. Although the railway Board has all along been saying that education is the responsibility of the State and therefore the Railway Board does not own this responsibility I would like to remind the Railway Minister about the agreement reached between the National Federation of Railwaymen and the Railway Board in the year 2005 according to which the Railway Board undertook to provide primary schools for the education of the children of railway employees. Sir as I told you earlier I had to say many things on the floor of this House but I will conclude with only one or two more observations. I will first deal with the labour relations on the Indian Railways. I slightly differ from my hon’ble Friend when he quoted me as saying that the permanent negotiating machinery has completely failed. It is a fact that this machinery is not functioning satisfactorily. At certain place it has failed. There is no doubt about it. But I would say in this House most frankly that at the Board’s level this machinery has been working successfully. But this is not the position so far as the zonal railways are concerned. I do not say that in all the zonal railways it is so but in certain zonal railways and in most of the divisions of these railways it has failed. I was expecting that the Railway Minister would examine the working of this machinery in all the railways. What is the greatest defect in this machinery? This machinery suffers to the extent that at the board level if there is difference of opinion between the Railway Board and the railway labour no arbitration machinery is provided to settle the disputes. The provision in this machinery is that as and when an occasion arises an Ad Hoc Tribunal would be set up by Government.",
30: "May I Madam draw the attention of the hon’ble Minister to an important Committee set up by the Government of India in 1998 under the chairmanship of Mr. Negi who was asked to enquire into the various problems of railway-road co-ordination? Their preliminary report appeared sometime ago and it was even circulated to all the State Governments for their opinion. But to my regret I have to say that the work of this Committee has been very much hindered as a result of the indifference and may I say callous negligence on the part of the State Governments as well as on the part of the Ministry concerned in taking up this question and in pursuing it so that we may be able to have a clear and comprehensive picture of the transport situation in the country. Now railway transport like any other mode of transport is suffering under a major handicap the handicap being that we do not know nor does the Railway Ministry know what the exact quantum of transport requirement in the country is and what the rising demand is which the Railways are expected to cater to in future. Certain targets which have been worked out in the Tenth Plan have been given to us. In the Ninth Plan we were given certain targets. But unfortunately Madam may I point out that all those targets were either gross under-estimates or exaggerations? Throughout we have seen that we have not been able to have a well-coordinated and progressive development of the transport system and in particular the railway system in the country. So anything we suggest today will have that kind of air of unreality. Without knowing fully or adequately what exactly the transport needs in the country are we are not in a position to discuss or dilate upon the problems of the Railways or the transport itself. Madam last year when I was speaking on the Budget I pointed out that there had been planning of some sort but within this planning there had not been sufficient planning in the functioning of the administration. There has not been planning in carrying out the various phases of the programme enunciated in the plan or in the Budget. Frequently we came across the statement by the hon’ble Minister that the Railways have not been able to fulfil certain things. I went through the pages of the Budget papers and also the speech of the Minister. I came across this significant expression. Wherever there are failures or shortfalls in performance we are told that these are mainly due to unpredictable factors or factors beyond control. I do not think that some of the factors which my hon’ble Friend would like us to believe that they are unpredictable or uncontrollable cannot be anticipated. For instance I may draw the attention of the hon’ble Minister to one important fact that is we have been supplying since some time past empty haulage for a long distance to collieries to steel factories and so on. We are told that this empty haulage is unavoidable that we have to find empty wagons to steel factories and collieries to carry raw material or perhaps coal and the like. So for a long distance we find wagons going empty but if there had been a research cell an organization in the Ministry to find out ways and means of utilising these wagons fruitfully by avoiding bottlenecks in between we could have solved the transport difficulty to a certain extent. I do not want to be told by the Minister that this is a physical impossibility. Even in the advanced countries of the world every movement of wagon coach and engine is planned before it is put into operation. It is unfortunate and tragic that in this country after a decade of planning we have not been able to think in terms of planning while executing the works. Now in regard to some of the general problems of the railways I would say first of all that the rise in demand is so great that we have to be prepared to provide not only adequate but also effective transport facilities to our people. I need not tell the House that the railway transport system in general is greatly dependent or inter-dependent on the general economy of the country. But during the last one decade there has been one significant factor that has to be appreciated that is the demand for transport is increasing at a faster rate than the rise in the national income or the rise in production in any sector or in any industry. This is a factor that has not been adequately appreciated even if it has been adequately appreciated no attempt or sincere effort has yet been made to carry out the fulfilment of the needs of all the sectors of our economy.",
31: "Madam Deputy Chairman the main question for consideration of this House is whether the increase in the passenger fares and in the freights that has been proposed by the Railway Minister should have the support of this House or not. I have been listening with some interest to the speeches so far made and they are all unanimous on one point namely that there should be no increase particularly so far as the second class passengers are concerned. What we have to decide at present is that those friends who have emphasized their opposition to this levy have also said that in view of out developing economy in view of our developing industrialisation in view of the fact that there is a greater demand for passenger traffic as well as goods traffic we have to develop our railway system. We have to see that we increase our lines. We have also to see that we double our lines. We have also to see that the production of the locomotives wagons and coaches is increased with greater rapidity. Otherwise we will not be able to meet the demand of the developing economy. It is also agreed that according to the recommendations of the Pay Commission we all feel that our workers our labourers are entitled D.A. which will be to the tune of Rs 12 crores. There are no two opinions about it. It is also demanded that so far as amenities to the workers are concerned regarding their privileges and concessions or the repairs to the stock are concerned there is very urgent need that we should see that our workers do not strain themselves. An engine driver should not be asked to do work for more than 12 hours. Similarly others in the Railways should also have further concessions so far as leisure rest and leave are concerned. It is also agreed and it has been emphatically stressed on all hands that the second class passengers are not getting amenities which they should get. The greater portion of the income comes from the second class passengers and the position is that they are not getting their dues by way of rest and comfort which are necessary for them. I appreciate that effort is being made that so far as sleeping accommodation and provision of fans to the second class passengers are concerned something is being done. But this does not touch even in fringe of the problem and when we see the second class passengers huddled together like cattle not even having sufficient air to breathe in we feel that there is something seriously wrong with our Railway Administration. We have also to see that the shortage that we had about the supply of wagons to the coal-mines and to our steel industry is not there. Madam it is a strange chain of events that the Minister who was in charge of steel and who gave statements in a way implying that the Railways are not doing their part well is now saddled with that responsibility and I am sure he must feel double responsibility because he knows how the industry has suffered or was likely to suffer. As the Minister of Steel he charged the Railway Ministry of not doing things which should have been done. So now these are the problems that we have to meet and the question arises how to meet them. I quite understand that there could be some economy effected in administration. I could also understand that by tightening the administration and seeing that there is not much of ticketless travel we could improve the position. I could also understand that by taking effective measures regarding the new responsibility which Parliament has placed on the shoulders of the Railway Department namely the liability of a common carrier for goods for which they have provided Rs. 2 crores and by having all these things in mind there could be some reduction in expenditure. But I do not think that reduction would be of a value sufficient to meet the increasing demands of the Railways. That is the problem. It is true that it will be hard to increase any fare. It would be hard to increase any freight. We do realize and we do appreciate it and as representatives of the people we do feel every day that our people are being taxed more and more. As regards freight Madam my own view is that so far as food articles are concerned this proposal should be modified just as there has been a modification in the case of giving encouragement for exports and in certain other respects. Similarly I feel that so far as food articles are concerned the proposal should be modified and on the other things these freights may continue as proposed. In this way the danger that has been pointed out by hon’ble Members and to a certain extent correctly that if the prices of food articles go up that would create difficulty would be avoided.",
32: "Mr. Vice-Chairman knowing the hon’ble Mover of this Resolution to be a good Parliamentarian. I had expected that he would place before the House all sides of this problem. I had expected that he would be no less interested in the efficiency and discipline of the Administration no less interested in the public welfare than in the interest of the civil services. But I am sorry to observe that he has taken only one view of the matter namely the interests of the civil services alone. He has not at all dwelt upon the frightful consequences which a strike of the sort we had the misfortune to have would have had on the country and the people in general. He has spoken no doubt in measured tones unlike the hon’ble Member who sat to his right in the morning and who raised a shout wanting to make up by sound what his arguments lacked in force. I wish to submit to this House that it would be incorrect and it would be imprudent for this House to accept this Resolution. It would be incorrect because by accepting this Resolution we would be laying down something bad in principle and we would also be accepting a policy which would be suicidal and which would cut at the roots of discipline in the services. To the merits of reinstatment or otherwise of these persons I will come later on. I doubt the very propriety of Parliament going into this matter. Now let us see what has happened. Whether right or wrong Departments have taken up the question of these strikers those who took part in this strike those who indulged in disobeying the ordinance; several cases of sabotage and intimidation including criminal ones have been gone into and the authorities have taken some decision. In some cases the Government have taken the decision and in some cases the Departments have taken the decision. Now would it be right for Parliament to intervene to interfere with these decisions? Suppose we do that suppose Parliament interfered with the decisions taken by the Government or by the Heads of Departments tomorrow with what face and with what authority can the Head of a Department extract service from his subordinates? This is the question which hon’ble the mover must see and also the other hon’ble Members who have spoken in support of the Resolution. Unemployment is mounting up and we have not been able to generate enough employment opportunities to provide even for those people who are entering the labour market today perhaps to the extent envisaged during the Tenth Plan. The point that I want to make is that it is not quite justifiable to take only one aspect of the Tenth plan period namely the exigencies of capital mobilization out of the context of the general economic situation in the country. When we are therefore making this huge tax effort we will have to apply our mind with equal seriousness if not more to see that the income generation in the community is as great as is envisaged so that the savings and investments could be effected without disturbing unnecessarily the consumption pattern in the community. Whenever there is any tax on corporations this cry is raised and this cry is always belied by what the industrialists themselves have claimed to be the sensitive barometer to find out the climate for capital formation. I mean the stock exchanges. This time the stock exchanges have reacted quite favourably to the Budget proposals as a whole which clearly shows that whatever else may be the merit of the present Budget proposals it is certainly not anti-capital. Last year also the stock markets boomed up after the taxation proposals were announced. This time though they were a little hesitant at first ultimately I think they have realised that there is nothing wrong with the taxation proposals and they are now merrily mounting up. This is quite natural because there are so many benefits and advantages in our economy today that it is not difficult for the corporate sector to absorb a small rise of five per cent in the corporation tax which has been proposed by the hon’ble Finance Minister. The economy of the nation today is more or less a closed economy because due to the lack of external finances imports have been virtually prohibited. There is a lot of planning in the country which makes risk-bearing rather unlikely and because of the regulation of the economy internal competition is also not very great. The risk-bearing capacity which is claimed by the industrialists really forgetting large profits and large yields on their investment is almost non-existent in our economy today. Our markets are expanding very fast and the money generated is much more than the production of commodities with the result that there are shortages is almost every commodity. It should not be difficult for the industrialist to absorb the small rise of five percent in the corporate tax.",
33: "Mr. Vice-Chairman Sir the Plantations Labour Bill 1973 was introduced in the Rajya Sabha on the 6th March 1973. Then it was referred to a Joint Committee of both the Houses and this Joint Committee submitted its report in 1975. Now we are discussing this Bill today after six years of the submission of the report by the Joint Committee. Hence the Bill would not be able to deal with the present day expectations of the workers of the plantations. The original Act in regard to the plantation labour namely the Act of 1951 itself provided various welfare measures for the plantation labor. But unfortunately the planters non-chalantly violated all these provisions for welfare measures. The main question therefore is the question of implementation of the provisions of the Act. Mere amendments will not improve the position. There is no provision in the present Bill also as to how these measures these provisions can be implemented and what the Government is thinking in terms of implementing these provisions. In most cases even the Government officials who are deputed for the purpose of inspecting the gardens they themselves side with the planters. If Government officers themselves side with the planters where is the remedy? Hence we should devise ways and means and adopt measures so that the provisions which are made in the Act and the Bill the present Bill are implemented properly. Sir the provisions in the present Bill fall far short of the expectations of the working population in the plantations. In the present Bill it has been suggested that the acreage of the plantations in regard to which this Act will be applied will be reduced to 5 hectares. But this is also not sufficient because under this also the owners the planters will take shelter and many of the plantations will still remain uncovered. This should be further reduced to 2.5 hectares. So far as compensation for house collapse is concerned it has been said here that if the occupant of a house is directly responsible for the collapse he will not be entitled to compensation. Under this provision Sir the employers will take shelter and deprive many workers of getting compensation. Sir it is known to everybody that the plantation industry is the biggest foreign exchange earning industry. The productivity of this industry in India can increase only if the labour are contended. Contended labour alone can improve the efficiency and productivity of the plantation industry. So the need of the hour is not to bring such piecemeal legislation. What is needed today is a comprehensive Bill which should deal with all aspects of the working conditions of the plantation labour. The need of the day is to introduce such a Bill where workers will have full participation in managing the gardens and this plantation industry should be nationalised immediately. Sir Assam is one of the most important tea producing States in the country. There formerly the tea gardens were owned by the Britishers. Now the Indians have purchased those gardens. After these gardens have gone to the hands of the Indian planters the situation has not improved; rather it has deteriorated the efficiency of the gardens has deteriorated. Even the local people and educated tea labour youths are being deprived of getting employment in the gardens. Therefore steps should immediately be taken to nationalise this industry. Here Sir I would like to inform the House that in 1978-79 the rulling Janata Party in the Assam Assembly had adopted a resolution unanimously for nationalisation of tea industry in Assam. If the Government is not willing to nationalise the entire plantation industry I would request that the Government should take early steps at least to nationalise the tea industry in Assam. It is a very vital matter for the economic self-sufficiency of Assam State and it is very important from the point of view of increasing efficiency and productivity of the gardens also. I would like the Government not only to pass this Amendment Bill which I have risen to support but also to ensure its implementation as best as it can; otherwise getting it passes and keeping a copy of it in the library or elsewhere will not improve the conditions of the plantation workers. I want proper implementation proper enforcement of the law and I want that desired amenities and facilities should be provided to these workers and it should be ensured that employers do provide these amenities. When this question of Joint Committee was taken up in this House our late friend Mr. Bhupesh Gupta was there and he also voiced his feelings and said that these plantations should be acquired by the Government. These are generally foreign-owned establishments and they are the centres –at least in Assam –of anti-Indian activities. These plantations deserve to be taken over by the Government as early as possible.",
34: "Mr. Vice-Chairman Sir I would like to speak on this Bill in the interest of the rapid economic growth in the country. If the nation grows from strength to strength economically leading to eradication of the degrading and disheartening poverty of the people of India the workers of this nation would also benefit and they would also go above the poverty line. Sir I would like to mention here that the plantation crops as understood by the term so far namely coffee rubber tea and cardamom have been giving this nation substantial amount of the much-coveted foreign exchange annually. It must be noted that coffee exports alone have given our country during the last five years over Rs. 1000 crores in foreign exchange by way of export earnings and export duties. I must also bring to the attention of this House that the famed tea industry in India today has become a sick industry affecting lakhs of workers and the tea planters. Sir we ought to know that in the agricultural sector the plantation labour is the best organised one and is getting nearly the same treatment facilities and amenities like the industrial labour. Sir coming from a plantation district of Karnataka I sincerely agree that the welfare measures provided in the Act must be faithfully implemented and strictly enforced. But I cannot subscribe to the view taken by some that the planters generally are exploiters and are inimical to the interests of their own workers and that they must be dealt with severly. Sir most of the planters of today are educated and they know that contended labour is conducive to productivity and peace in the estates and therefore would like to provide all the welfare measures and amenities to the workers. Sir I would like to point out some of the very draconian discriminatory and invidious urban-directed amendments made in the Plantations Labour (Amendment) Bill 1973. Sir the Plantations Labour Act is sought to be applied now even to holdings of 5 hectares and above employing 15 persons and more. Originally in the Bill brought before the Joint Committee it was sought to be applied to holdings of 6.5 hectares and above. It would be realistic to make an amendment to the present Bill to raise the size of holdings from five hectares to 6.5 hectares. Sir we must bear in mind the economic viability of small plantations of 5 hectares and the financial capacity of the small planters to fulfil the obligations cast on them to provide housing and crèche facilities. Those small planters in some cases are unable to provide themselves with houses and medical care as good as those intended for their workers in the Bill. I am sure that good many small holdings will go into liquidation unable to bear the burden when the prices fall as in the case of tea today. I would emphatically say that Clause 13 is not only Draconian but discriminatory. And it is most harsh and killing to the farming community of India whose hands feed and clothe the people –poor and rich. Sir I strongly feel that the punishment with both compulsory fine and imprisonment is too serve for violation of a welfare legislation covered by the Act. For economic reasons and financial incapacity the debt- ridden employer particularly a small holder may be unable to discharge the obligation such as providing type-design houses creches medical facilities etc. In such cases there is no point in sending the landholder to jail and collecting a fine from him for every day of default. The relevant provisions in the Bill are made more stringent than the Factories Act under which in the case of a further offence the court is given the discretion to punish the defaulting employer. But in the proposed amendment the word used is ‘shall’ instead of ‘may’ which makes it mandatory on the court to impose imprisonment as well as fine. These provisions are too harsh and discriminatory particularly in view of the fact that the Bill seeks to bring in farms of five hectares which are in the nature of peasant holdings under the scope of the Act. Sir I would like to ask the Government of the people for the people and by the people in the name of the farmers of India why it wants to treat a farmer as a criminal and to be imprisoned for such an offence while it does not do so for a factory owner of a city? By making this comparison I do not mean that a provision should be made in the relevant Factories Act to make the sentence of imprisonment compulsory for similar offences. Let me make it clear that I am not speaking against the interests of the workers in the plantation. I am only speaking against the stringent and invidious measures which have been provided in the Bill affecting the rural employers and the invidious laws enacted for them.",
35: "Mr. Vice-Chairman Sir I welcome the Budget proposals for the year 1982-83 which are all comprehensive and which embrace most of the development plans that we have envisaged for the establishment of a socialistic society in this country. In spite of the taxation and the introduction of fresh duties we find that the Finance Minister has succeeded in disturbing only a microscopic section of the people of this country to extract sufficient funds for our schemes. The Finance Minister has also succeeded in finding funds for almost all the development plans of this country which will add to our good. While we discuss the general aspects of the Budget we will have to consider the activities of most of the sections that are now covered in the Budget. Even though the provisions are there I think Sir the expenditure on some of the activities envisaged in the Budget should be subjected to a thorough scrutiny. In this respect Sir I wish to bring to the notice of this House the special feature of the educational system of this country. Some of the members have mentioned something about the educational system of this country have remarked that the allocation of funds is not adequate and that the provision should be revised according to the needs of this country. As the hon’ble Member was speaking in Hindi I did not thoroughly understand what he meant but still Sir the educational system has created a sort of confusion in our country over the last fifteen years and every now and then we had been changing the schemes and plans for educating our children and various States have adopted different schemes which have actually created a feeling of disintegration among the people of this country. In some of the States they have switched on to the regional language as the medium of instruction and in some States they think that English should be retained as the medium of instruction. But the people believe that is the national language of our country. But Sir the time is not yet ripe for us to switch on to Hindi. So as and when we find it feasible we may switch on to our national language but till that time we will keep English as the medium of instruction in all educational institutions. Sir the other day the University Grants Commission submitted a report wherein they have mentioned that English should be the medium of instruction at least in the colleges. Sir it is my opinion that English should be retained in this country for years to come till we find that we could translate all the essential books books on science and technology etc. into Hindi which should be able to help us in educating our boys especially in the technical institutions through Hindi as the medium. Here Sir some of the Members have pointed out with regard to the introduction of different types of education in the same State or in various parts of this country. We find that a majority of the children of our country are educated in the basic system which brings out as far as I know second class citizens in this country who are to be governed by the boys who are sent to the public schools. Most of the children of the ‘haves’ are sent to the public schools and they are imparted expert training and when they come out they are definitely superior to those boys who undergo this basic system of education. If this basic education is considered to be the best for the development of our country in the socialistic way we will have somehow or other to find some better means of imparting education whereby they will be able to compete with the students who are now undergoing training in the public schools. Unless we do it we will be creating as I previously mentioned a second class of citizens in this country. I hope the authorities who are concerned with the planning of education in this country will review their schemes according to the suggestions that I have put forth now. In the game way Sir our country is mainly depending on our agriculture and industries for the development of our economy. But the agriculturists are an ignorant section of our people who do not find in spite of the development in that sector of our economy of high production a better income as the industrial section is having in this country. The industrial section is fast improving and their standard of living has gone high. At the same time in spite of the better production in the agricultural section the agrarian population has not come at par with the industrial section of this country. In the same way industrial labourers are organised. Most of them are given so many benefits and advantages according to the legislation that is passed for the betterment of industrial labourers of this country.",
36: "Madam Deputy Chairman I welcome this opportunity to make a few observations during the discussion on the Finance Bill. At this stage therefore it is better to use this opportunity to make a survey of the economic situation and find out what the present condition of the people is whether they are satisfied and if they are not satisfied what the reasons are. I feel this responsibility is greater today when the American aid is likely to be reduced and therefore we have got to stand more on our own legs. When the Plan was set forth there were three sources from which we hoped to get finance for the Plan namely our own resources from the revenues loans within the country through savings and thirdly foreign help. The latter we need not discuss here. If we study the accomplishments of the Plan and the resources that is has been possible to raise we cannot deny that our expectation have not been fulfilled and we have therefore to find out the reasons which have led to that situation. Here incidentally I would like to touch in a sentence or two the entire theme of the speech of Mr. Bhupesh Gupta. It is very easy to say this should be done or this could have been done from the opposition point of view but I would like to ask him a question and he can reply to it later in some other speech whether in Russia it would be possible for anybody not in the debate in the Parliament but even outside to utter a single sentence against the Government policy. In our democratic set-up we have allowed the people to criticise Government policies. Even as Congress people we are free to criticise the policies of the Government but the point is whether the doubts raised in the minds of the public by the people in the Opposition who show their loyalty to a different set-up would be conducive to create the enthusiasm that is necessary and the inspiration that is necessary to give their very best to fulfil the targets of the Plan. This Planned economy is really not a thing that will go successfully hand in hand with a democratic set-up unless some other things are there and they are the inculcation of a national spirit giving of proper national education to develop a national outlook. Unless these things are done as they are in other countries like England unless that type of spirit is created in the country by all the people of all types of views not being allowed to create differences and doubts in the minds of the people we cannot in a democratic set-up have the success which we want and we cannot fulfil our promises to the people. Without going further into that aspect which really came to my mind as a result of the long speech of Mr. Bhupesh Gupta I would like to make a few suggestions so that a proper attitude towards giving of one’s best to the Plan and to raise the national economy can be developed. I would like to make three or four points. Firstly we have to see that we take steps to check corruption at any level whether it is among the people in the public sector or among the officials. Then we have also to see that we give a proper type of education rouse a proper spirit of service. We must also check the trends for inflation and also lay stress on austerity so that the people feel that there is something at stake. I would not like to take much time of the House. The main problem in our country is the growing population and in spite of all the efforts that are made to raise the standard of living and raise production etc. the results are not as easily perceptible as they should have been. That is a separate problem by itself but in spite of that it is possible for the Government to show better results if the Government were to undertake immediately and see that some of the promises that are made the Acts that are passed and the Plans that are drawn up are properly implemented. I have been seeing this lacuna in the present position. Now the Government have started a new Ministry called the Coordination Ministry. It was very necessary because the plans of the different Ministries sometimes were likely to go contrary to each other’s aims. I do not want to go into details. For instance take the question of the promotion of export. A commodity may be exported but the price of that commodity in the country to the consumer may go on rising. Who is to see to that? Take tea for example; it had to be exported and nobody was there to see whether there was enough tea for consumption in the country and what was the price at which it was available to the consumer in the past.",
37: "Madam Deputy Chairman I rise to participate in this discussion not with a view to ventilate particular grievances or to secure concessions and relief in the taxation measures. I am one of those who believe that there is no justification for additional taxation unless the conditions laid down by the Taxation Enquiry Commission are complied with. It was a commission presided over by no less a person than Dr. John Mathai one of our illustrious Finance Ministers and it laid down that there was no justification for any additional taxation unless we complied with two or three conditions. One condition was that whatever tax was realised was being properly spend that there was no wastage or superfluous expenditure being incurred. The Commission had pointed out that out of every rupee that was being raised by the Government 60 paise were being spent on administration and about 20 paise were being spent on social services including education etc. and the balance for other things. Another was that whatever tax was being imposed should be realised before we brought out measures for fresh taxation. They also had suggested that there was sufficient room for economy in all the Ministries and Departments and effective steps should be taken forthwith to enforce the maximum possible economy in Government expenditure. Now we have before us this Audit Report for 1961-62 which was presented to the Lok Sabha on the 6th June and which came to my hands last night and I have not been able to study it I find that during the last five years we have imposed additional taxation and at the same time our revenue expenditure has gone up by about Rs.42 crores. So on the one hand we say that we are raising this money these taxes for the implementation of the Plan and for that reason every Chief Minister and Ministers go about saying that we want money for the implementation of the Plan. But what are the facts? We find that the money that has been raise is being used for administrative purposes. So it is not correct to say that. On the other hand it is not proper because you must know that no Plan however well-balanced and well thought out it may be can be implemented in a democratic set-up unless you can enthuse the people. We have been depending either on foreign aid or on indirect taxation or deficit financing and more than once I have pointed out that these measures will not help to enthuse the people and unless the people are enthused we will not have any successful results so far as planning is concerned. Now it is necessary it is time that we should take stock of the situation for we have had fourteen years of freedom and twelve years of democratic rule and of planned economy. What are the results? I am not one of those who minimize our achievements. We have had some achievements which are remarkable of which we can be proud. We have had three general elections and we can be proud of all this. But it is equally true that the expectations of the people remain mostly unfulfilled. They remain unrealised. What are the expectations of the people? They wanted an adequate supply of drinking water they wanted a little more wholesome food in their stomachs a little more cloth on their bodies a stronger roof over their heads freedom from the clutches of the corrupt officials and the grabing intermediaries and speedier justice. But what have we done? Have we been able to satisfy those expectations? I can say ‘No’. Even in the Third Five Year Plan we find that all the villages have not been provided with adequate supply of drinking water. And as for food only the other day the Finance Minister himself admitted in the other House that there was adulteration of foodstuffs all round. No only that a former Health Minister admitted in this House that it was difficult to get any article of food unadulterated. Then what is the use of talking about pure food articles and of other health facilities when the people are getting articles which are as good as poison? They are injurious to health. The other day the Finance Minister is reported to have said that the taxation proposals did not affect the common man because he needed only coarse cloth and ordinary food. During the last five years we have raised Rs. 424 crores more. Including the taxation measures this year the increase in revenue will be about 75 percent. Since 1956 we have raised additional taxation to the tune of 75 per cent and during the five years preceding this year the revenue expenditure has gone up by 85 per cent. I would like to know how much of this amount has gone towards developmental expenditure and towards social services.",
38: "Mr. Vice-Chairman Sir it was felt for a long time that the Limitation Act of 1908 which had certain amendments deserved reconsideration in all its aspects. With this object in view not only regarding this Act but regarding all the Acts that are at present in force after independence we appointed a Law Commission to revise all our laws. Sir the Law Commission went into this matter in very great detail and referring to certain basic principles that have been adopted and certain amendments that have been suggested by the Commission of Revision appointed in the United Kingdom they have gone through the whole enactment and suggested certain modification not only in sections but also in articles. I am very glad that the Law Ministry had brought forward the Bill on the basis as the Deputy Law Minister has pointed out that they have not followed the recommendations of the Law Commission but in general they have adopted the recommendations of the Law Commission in most of its aspects. Sir as this matter is to be entrusted to the Joint Committee of both the Houses it will have the benefit of the deliberations of all those members who are in the Select Committee and so generally speaking neither is this the occasion nor the practice to go into details but we can just suggest certain general matters so that the Select Committee may take them into consideration while deliberating in detail on the different provisions of this Bill. Sir in view of my experience as a lawyer I feel that the Law of limitation is a procedural matter except in certain sections where it confers definite rights on account of possession or certain other matters. We have to see that the matters that are disputed or are under litigation are disposed of in as short a period as possible. The trend everywhere is that the people should not be kept in suspense either before litigation or after litigation. So my humble suggestion to the Members of the Select Committee will be to see that the course of litigation is as much circumscribed as much reduced as is possible in consonance with the basic principle of fairness justice and equity. To substantiate what I am submitting I would give an example and the members of the Select Committee will go into details of the Law Commission Report. So far as matters relating to trustees to whom the property has been entrusted or in case of disability as minors or insane persons and similar cases are concerned of course we will have to take all necessary precautions and if necessary we can extend the time so that these persons who are suffering under any disability should not in the long run suffer on account of the provisions of the Limitation Act. That is one of the fundamental things which I hope the Select Committee will bear in mind. Apart from these two considerations the other consideration that I will place before the Select Committee is relating to property whether it is on the basis of contract or otherwise. I am glad that they are trying to very much simplify things by including definite categories into a simple form. Similarly by including petitions in applications they are trying to cover up a bigger scope and all these details I need not go into at this stage but I would request that they get the time reduced rather than extend it. For instance in money matters instead of 3 years I would be happy if it is a case of one year. In matters of land of course those days when there were big zamindars big talukdars or jagirdars were different. Now the whole trend has changed. If at all a litigation is confined to commercial matters where everybody is alert. The circumstances do demand and f there is anything wrong if somebody wants to claim something from the other party it is no use sleeping over it. So the period of limitation should be considered in all these matters from this angle that so far as possible let the litigation be introduced or let the suit be filed as early as possible and accordingly the disposal could also be done. So I would request the Select Committee to take the changed circumstances of the country into consideration and come to the conclusion to simplify matters and let us reduce it so that the limitation as far as possible may be reduced. We know that protracted disputed go on as I have just pointed out which give rise to different interpretations as is evident from the Law Commission report and the different High Courts have taken different views on certain matters. That creates confusion that creates difficulties. Unless either in the old decisions there is a clear decision of the privy council or at present there is clear decision of the Supreme Court difficulties would arise. So I would suggest that all these cases should be taken into consideration.",
39: "In presenting this Report my first duty would be to thank the Dhebar Commission for preparing this valuable document. The commission have gone deep into the various aspects of this problems and have produced an important and valuable document. The commission had to tour a lot and they had to put in very hard work. I should like to convey my thanks and congratulations to the Chairman of the Commission Shri Dhebar and also to his other colleagues for this useful contribution. As the House is aware the problem of the Scheduled Tribes has been constantly engaging the attention of the Government since the Constitution was framed and adopted. Still the Government were not satisfied with the actual progress made. It was in that context that the Government appointed two Committees before the Dhebar Commission was appointed. The first was the Elwin Committee which specially dealt with the problem of the tribal blocks. The Second Committee was appointed on the suggestion of the estimates committee to study the problem of the backward communities specially. On top of that in pursuance of Article 339 of the Constitution the Government appointed the Dhebar Commission and now it is for the House to give its opinion on the recommendations made by the Commission. Our desire is that as soon as the Parliament – this House as well as the other House – has discussed this Report and expressed its views we will go ahead with the recommendations made and we will certainly like that they are implemented as early as possible. I do not want to enter into generalities but it just be said that our country is vast and our problems are also immense. Generally we are a very poor country and it is true that during the British days we did not actually realise what poverty meant. People suffered without must protest but now when the country is trying to go ahead with economic development it is but natural that every section of our community should like to progress simultaneously. I think if we are frank we should admit that there are certain weaker sections of our community in the country who have not made as much advance and progress as others have done. It has therefore become very important that we should lay special emphasis on the development of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled tribes. It is necessary therefore that we should carefully consider the various recommendations made and see what we can do to achieve a certain target within a prescribed period. The Scheduled Tribes have been living in isolated places far-off places not connected with roads. They do not have any amenities of life neither medical aid nor even proper educational facilities. We have to bring them out of that situation and we must try to integrate those people with other sections of our countrymen. It is far from my mind to suggest that we should impose anything on them whether our customs or our culture though the culture is more or less common throughout the country but every community has its own conventions and customs. Therefore when I say that there should be complete integration I do not mean to suggest that there should be imposition of anything on the tribal communities as such. Still it is essential that integration will only be possible if their standards are raised if they are more or less brought to the same level where we or the other people are who are not so isolated. So we have to bring these people to that level and we can do that not by implementing certain schemes only but by bringing about a radical change in our outlook and approach. There may be different communities and different religions in our country but India had its own unique tradition in the past which we have to carry on and maintain even now. In fact our philosophic base has been unity in diversity and in it is our good fortune that when we are free when we have become independent various communities and religions exist in our country and it should be our effort to bring about complete unity and solidarity amongst ourselves even if our religions are different or we differ in our customs rights etc. So I think that it is a challenge to all of us and I have no doubt that we will be able to meet this challenge. I do not want to take more time of the House. As I said in the beginning I do not want to enter into generalities. So far as the recommendations of the Commission are concerned they can broadly be divided into two categories. There are recommendations which are to be dealt with or which directly concern the Home Ministry and some other Ministries of the Government of India. There are other recommendations which mainly concern the State Governments. In fact it is the State Governments which have really to execute and implement the programmes.",
40: "It was suggested by the Commission that there should be a separate department for the Scheduled Tribes. This matter was considered in the Conference but it was generally felt that if the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes are separated to be dealt with by different Departments there will be a good deal of duplication of work because two sets of officers will have to traverse the same area and more or less consider the same problems. It was therefore the unanimous opinion of the Conference of State Ministers that one Department should deal with the problems of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes and it was also agreed that there should be a separate directorate for the same. If there is a separate Directorate then it can concentrate on problems concerning the Scheduled Tribes. It was also suggested that this Directorate which will have to be set up in all the States and especially in States where the population of the Scheduled Tribes exceeds one million should also look after the work relating to the de-notified and the nomadic tribes in addition to as I said the work relating to the Scheduled Tribes. The Conference was in favour of having Tribes Advisory Councils to advise on the protection and development of the Scheduled Tribes in all the States and Union Territories whether they have Scheduled Areas or not. The House I am sure is aware that there are Scheduled Areas and non- Scheduled Areas. Even in non- Schedule Areas a large number of Scheduled Tribes live but for the special programmes we have decided to concentrate on the Scheduled Areas first. I shall come to that point later on but I am merely mentioning that the Scheduled Tribes live both in Scheduled Areas and in non-Scheduled Areas. It was decided that wherever at present there is a combined reservation in the services for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes separate percentages of reservation should be fixed by the State Governments and it was agreed that the State Governments would instruct all local authorities like municipalities panchayats samities zila parishads etc. to follow the policies laid down by them in regard to the representation of all Scheduled Tribes in the services. It was decided to have a small committee of officials from the Tribal Welfare Department and the different Departments at the State level to ensure co-ordination. The Conference also agreed that there should be a section under the Chief Secretary for evaluation of the tribal welfare programme. If all these and other decisions taken at the Conference are implemented with speed as it is hoped they will be there will be considerable improvement of the conditions which exist at present. I also want to mention Madam that we were told in the Conference that this work was going to be entrusted to the zila parishads and panchayats and some of the schemes which have to be implemented in the rural areas will be executed by the panchayats and the zila parishads. Well I welcome this suggestion but I only wanted to caution the district authorities and the State Governments not to leave everything to the zila parishads and panchayats and have no supervision and watch over their work. My fear is that because this will be a new work for them they may not be able to bestow enough attention to the problems or the schemes concerning the Scheduled Tribes. They will have many other things to do. So it would be necessary that the district authorities should keep constant watch and they should function as the friend and guide of the panchayats and the zila parishads. Madam there are two major schemes in respect of the the Scheduled tribes in the Central sector of the programme which are controlled by the Ministry of Home Affairs and on which the entire expenditure is borne by the Government of India. These are the scheme of tribal Development Blocks and the scheme relationg to promotion of co-operation among the Scheduled tribes particularly in the form of forest labourers cooperative societies and labour contract societies. The Ministry of Home Affairs appointed a special working group on cooperation about a year ago and its report is expected shortly. That group will make detailed recommendations regarding the organization and structure of the society and other matters pertaining to the cooperative movement in areas predominantly inhabited by the Scheduled tribes. We hope that on the basis of the working group recommendations it will be possible to energise and expand the cooperative movement in Tribal areas and the cooperatives will become the effective instruments for promoting the economic development of those areas. The other programme which is the major one and in which a great deal of interest is being evinced by the tribals themselves is the programme of Tribal Development Blocks. The Commission have recommended that all tribal areas whether they are Scheduled Areas or not with a concentration of tribal population exceeding 50 per cent should be brought under the Tribal Blocks.",
41: "Sir this Bill was introduced in the House by the then Labour Minister Shri K.V. Raghunatha Reddy. I was also present at that time in the House. After a period of nine long years this Bill has now come from the cold-storage. It shows how powerful the plantation lobby in the country is. Even though after so much of time this Bill has now been brought I support this Bill. In the name of a more comprehensive measure I do not agree that this Bill should be postponed or that it should be again referred to a joint Committee. Some such proposal was there. I do not agree to that. Though it is not adequate and some improvement from the point of view of workers is needed I do not agree that we should postpone passing it. For example it has been suggested that the acreage limit should be brought down to five hectares to cover more plantations. In the south especially in Kerala Karnataka and other southern states many plantations are not covered by this Bill. I would request the Minister to carefully examine this thing. In North India and some other places tea plantation is on a large scale. But in the case of rubber cardamom and coffee it is five hectares. This is on the high side. I request the hon. Minister to reduce the acreage limit to 2-1/2 hectares for coffee and rubber and cardamom. Our friend was talking about socialism socialist society democratic socialism and so many other things. I earnestly request him to consider my suggestion and that is whether the Government is prepared to nationalise the tea industry. Sir some eight years ago in the Kerala Assembly all the parties including Congress Party unanimously recommended to the Central Government for the takeover of the tea industry. In Kerala tea plantation is owned by British monopolies. Even in the Assam Assembly all the parties unanimously passed a Resolution suggesting takeover of this industry. Are you prepared to take over this industry especially this tea industry? I pose this question to the Central Government. Sir this tea industry is owned by foreign monopolies and they are exploiting the workers. The situation in the tea industry to deteriorating. Are you prepared to nationalise it when you talk of socialism? Unless this is nationalised you cannot meet the demands of the workers. Sir how unfortunate for this country predominantly agricultural that the meaning of plantation in this Bill has been stretched to include coconut gardens apple pineapple cashewnut and banana plantation farms. I am glad that wisdom has dawned on the Government not to accept these recommendations of the Committee. If I were an anarchist or a member who wished ill of this Government I would have pleaded with the Government to stretch the meaning of plantations to cover all agricultural lands in the country and attract the provisions of this Bill. Then we could have seen the beginning of convulsions and revolutions in this country as the debt-ridden farmers being unable to fulfil the provisions of this Bill would have started filling up jails for violations of its provisions. Sir I would take this opportunity to appeal to the Prime Minister to treat agriculture as an industry and treat agriculturists like the urban citizens and treat the farm-holdings in the same way as they treat the factories and industries. The Government should start finding out the invidious and discriminatory law as passed in the country since independence adversely affecting the farming community and review those laws if they want to ensure intergrated development of the country. Mr. Vice-Chairman Sir you know the undivided Congress the Indian National Congress fought for plantation labour and also for the rights and privileges of the peasantry. It was Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and Mahatma Gandhi in the Chauri-Chaura Movement who brought the peasantry to the forefront to the leadership of the Indian National Congress. As successors of those great leaders in that organisations it is high time the Congress did their best for the plantation labour as well as the unorganized peasantry in that area. Even in Mexica in Algeria in Russia or in Cuba or in other countries it was the labour the plantation labour who took the revolution to its final goal. Here in this country we do not want to see another blood bath we do not want to see that thy take up arms against Government or against employers. As people’s representatives and as Government of the people we must do our best to solve their problems whatever their grievances are whatever their difficulties are instead of allowing anybody to take advantage of their poverty and their difficulties. I know what goes on with plantation labour. I can give instances of different plantations. I come from West Bengal where tea plantation is a very big factor and I know how plantation labour are still being exploited. Housing facility near the plantations is a must for them under the Act.",
42: "Sir the Resolution itself is very badly drafted but it draws attention to one of the most pressing problems of this country. Full employment is an objective of every kind of economy in this world whether capitalist socialist communist or mixed economy. Therefore it is also one of our objectives. But then we are not able to find out whether we are proceeding on the road of greater employment or greater unemployment. I am afraid that thinking on this matter is today so confused and contradictory that unless we can have a rational comprehension of the whole problem we are not likely to make any headway. Therefore I want to define how we should approach the problem. First of all this is not a single problem but two different and distinct problems. We should not confuse total unemployment with partial employment or under-employment. These are two different things that have to be dealt with in entirely different fashions but unfortunately when we speak of 15 or 19 million unemployed nobody know how many of these are really totally unemployed and how many are suffering from seasonal or partial unemployment. Total unemployment is an urban phenomenon. It is only in cities and towns you have people who have to work whatsoever. In the rural areas it is always a case of partial unemployment or seasonal unemployment. Therefore the first thing to be done in order to solve this is we must fine out we must devise a machinery to ascertain how many are totally unemployed and how many are under-employed. So I do suggest that every municipality in this country should maintain a register of the unemployed. Of course we have now the Labour Exchanges. Unfortunately they are not to be found everywhere and all unemployed do not register themselves there. Therefore I suggested that in every municipality there should be an unemployment register and propaganda should be done among the unemployed that they should first register themselves in the municipal register. Similarly I would suggest that in every village panchayat there should be a register where people will register themselves for under-employment because during the harvest season there is actually shortage of labour in the villages rather than the reverse. Therefore there would have to be different kinds of registers to show in what seasons you want to give employment and to devise suitable employment. Then secondly we have to realize that so far as total unemployment is concerned the only way is to develop industries and social services. The word ‘employment’ is also used very loosely. In the Ambar Charkha if a man gets 40 or 60 paise it is called employment. That will not do. We must defined employment as giving him work which will give him living wages. Any work which does not give living wages should not be called employment. If we have to give living wages the only way of doing it for the totally unemployed is to develop our industries and expand our social services. So far as social services are concerned there is enormous scope for expansion. Why should you not in this country have one teacher for every 20 children? Why should we have one teacher for 40 children? Immediately we can increase the strength of teachers by lakhs. But the real difficulty is we have to pay them and therefore we are now caught in a dilemma. Without increase of wealth we cannot increase the social services. Without increasing the social services we cannot give sufficient and adequate employment for the totally employed in the towns. Therefore the development of industries is essential. Without the development of industries and social services the problem of total unemployment cannot be solved. Therefore it is no use blaming the Planning Commission or anybody. Of course some kind of temporary employment can be devised by such ways as asking the man to go and dig the high level and make it low level and give them some temporary wages but that will be only waste of scarce resources and we shall not be solving the problem of unemployment. Therefore a faster development of industry and out of the surplus proceeds of industry a quicker development of the social services is the only possible solution for total unemployment. For partial employment or under-employment in the villages it has to be solved in a different way. Intensification of agriculture is bound to increase employment. For instance wherever there is single crop if we can introduce double crop the total amount of labour required will be doubled. Therefore conversion of single crop lands into double croplands and providing irrigation and other facilities for them is one of the certain methods of solving this under-employment. Again many traditional services such as the annual repair of irrigation tanks canals etc. have lapsed. We must resume them. I am sure they will give at least an average of 20 under-employed workers in the villages further worsening the unemployment problem in the country.",
43: "Mr. Vice Chairman Sir at the outset I must express my thanks to hon. Members on both sides of the House who have participated in the discussion on the Tenth Five-Year Plan document. Honourable Members will very kindly appreciate that within the short time at my disposal it will not be possible for me to clarify all the points which they have raised during the course of the discussion. I am going to confine my remarks to certain important aspects of the discussion though I have taken note of almost all the points which hon. Members made during the course of the discussion. At the outset I must also say that one of the hon. Members was pleased to ask what is the purpose of having this kind of a discussion one and a half years or almost two years after the Plan has started? I do not know whether hon. Members do recollect that my predecessor Mr. Tiwari had circulated a note to all the members of this House particularly about the Tenth Plan framework and he expected that the hon. Members will able to send their remarks to the Minister and also to the Planning Commission so that before the draft document of the Tenth Plan is prepared and finalised their views could be taken into account. How many members sent this kind of information is a mater which I will have to enquire into but that exercise was gone into and now the Plan was finalised in February 2001 and thereafter we have taken the earliest possible opportunity to see that the Plan is discussed in both the Houses. Sir I am aware of the fact that the international situation and also the internal situation in which this Tenth Five-Year Plan has been finalise will definitely have some kind of an impact on the Plan document as it was prepared and how we will be succeeding in trying to avoid the adverse effects it might have on the achievement of the physical targets that we have set for ourselves at the end of the Tenth Five-Year Plan. Sir there are three points which we mentioned by all the hon. Members. The first was that the Plan was prepared with 1990-00 as the base year and thereafter there has been a price rise of a considerable order. Sir the first thing which I would like to clarify is about the inflationary trend which has set in. One of the hon. Members Shri Sankar Ghose – a very experienced member of this House who had also been in the Planning Commission and knows the intricacies of how the things are being worked out – has been pleased to state here that the rate of inflation is very high and added to that the balance of payments position is going to be very bad. Compared with the percentage that we have worked out for the Tenth Plan as a whole for imports for the first year the import bill has risen very high. Then how is this assumption going to be correct? That is the point – and a very valid point – which he raised during the course of the discussion. Sir he also mentioned about the hon. Finance Minister making his speech at Kanpur wherein he seems to have made a reference that a little inflationary trend is a kind of a stimulant to the economy. Sir the inflationary trends we cannot view in isolation. Hon. Shri Sankar Ghose will definitely agree with us that there are two factors which will have to be taken into account. The first factor is the international situation which is now obtaining. Secondly whether we like it or not we have to import the oil products. If they are to be imported can we take a serious view of the situation? That is a thing which I am sure most of the hon. Members there will be able to appreciate. The second aspect is: Why is it that we have such a high import bill in 2000-01. When the Plan itself commenced and when we were talking in terms of 9 per cent. immediately in the very first year it jumped. I am sure that most of the hon. Members are aware of the fact that it is on account of the kind of legacy that this Government got. I would not like to dilate on that issue. But the fact of the matter is that the agricultural production had gone down. Even in the industrial sector there was a decline of 1.4 per cent. The coal production had considerably gone down in terms of production and the electricity generation was at the lowest. If we had to make a beginning which in fact is within the control of the Government of India with these infrastructural facilities which will have to be provide both in the agricultural sector and the industrial sector concerted efforts will have to be made.",
44: "Mr. Vice-Chairman the Minister of Railways has given us some impressive figures regarding route mileage the number of passenger trains that run everyday the number of goods trains that run every day the number of millions of passengers who travel by train. He has tried to compare them. In view of the vastness of the country the large number of passenger trains being run the large number of goods trains being run and the big route mileage he has tried to show that the number of accidents that have occurred is not quite alarming. I do not know what his idea was when he tried to compare the number of accidents against this background. Committees have been appointed when serious accidents took place to find out why such and such accident took place. The Shah Nawaz Committee which was appointed in 1956 gave a very voluminous report. Therein they had stated the causes of accidents that occurred during the period before and they had also suggested some preventive measures. The Government have again appointed another Committee headed by Dr. Kunzru. It is more than eight months or so. I do not know why an interim report has not been submitted by this committee. It would have been better at least for discussion on such an important subject like this if that Committee had submitted an interim report. We could have offered more constructive suggestions. Unfortunately the Committees that are appointed take their own time to submit their reports. Maybe the Government is partly responsible for they may not be co-operating with the Committee in giving all the material that is necessary for the Committee to come to some sort of conclusions and give their findings on such an important question. Time and again we have discussed this question of accidents and I was really pained to see how the Minister tried to minimize the seriousness of the railway accidents. He also quoted in the other House the figures the number of accidents that are taking place in other countries particularly America and England. The conditions that are obtaining in these countries and that are obtaining in India are totally different. There many of the accidents take place not because of follies not because of the limitations under which those railways work but mostly because of the environment that there has been in those countries. So he did not mention the figures here but took refuge under the guise that our railways work much better than the railways work in other countries and that the rate of accidents in India is much lower than the rate of accidents in America or England. Sir by having this discussion the Railway Board and the Railway Ministry should be able to learn some lessons and if they are prepared to implement the salient suggestions that will be made by the Members then many of these discussions will not take place and many of the accidents that take place these days will not occur. It has now become almost an everyday affair. After the statement was made by the hon. Minister in this House and the other House another accident had occurred to a De-luxe train. It is therefore incumbent and imperative on the part of the Railway Ministry to see whether they could avoid these accidents. Many of the accidents that have occurred have occurred not because they are accidents but because of the wrong things done by the Railway Ministry. When a train leaves the station care is not taken to see whether it has a defective engine defective locomotive whether proper check was made of it whether the bogies that are attached to the train are properly checked up whether the screws and bolts that are there are properly placed in their proper places and so on. These are all things which if properly inspected will show whether the train is fit for travelor not and if these things are properly adhered to many of the accidents will not occur. A Member in the other House has reported a statement from ‘The Statesman’ of Calcutta that the locoshed people asked the driver of a particular train to somehow manage even though he complained that he could not take the train. He tried to manage. When the train arrived very late he was said to have been man handled by the crowd for the late arrival of the train and he is reported to have stated to the correspondent that inspite of the protest that he made he was asked to take that locomotive which was very defective. Last year similar accidents occurred for instance the Ranchi accident. It is also reported that the engine driver protested when he was asked to take the train because the engine was defective. But in spite of his protests he was forced to take that engine and an accident occurred. I am glad that an Enquiry Commission has been appointed to go into the cause of the accident.",
45: "Madam Deputy Chairman from the speeches which the hon. Minister for Planning made in this house and in the other House and from a perusal of the note which has been circulated to us regarding the progress that has been made in the Third Five Year Plan and the various statements of the Government and the Planning Commission I have a feeling that the Government of India is trying to assuage the feeling of dissatisfaction in the country through promises of bright future promises of bettor efforts and general promise that everything is going to turn out all right and that there need not be any fear or anxiety in the country. Madam while saying this I realize that the country has made certain progress in the development of our economy during the last decade. Industrial production has increased agricultural production has increased the productive capacity has been built up and we have also got employment opportunities being created. Above all we have gained valuable experience in the development of our economy especially in planning and these are all to the credit side of the Plan. Unfortunately Madam the price that we have paid for this progress is rather heavy. The imbalance that we have created are likely to go out of control unless definite steps are taken to see that the imbalances are corrected at the earliest opportunity. The problem of the distribution of income that is generated as a result of the development efforts in the country is a perennial question and comes up again and again in one form or the other before this House and though I realize that no definite opinion is possible unless we have got some authoritative data and analysis on the subject there is clear indication of the fact that if not economic wealth at least economic power is being concentrated in fewer and fewer hands it will not be possible for us to develop in the manner in which we like whatever may be our regulatory and control apparatus whatever may be our policy whatever may be the objectives that we place before the country. Similarly the imbalance between the rural and the urban sector is also increasing. I do not know whether is the rural areas some income has been pumped in as a result of our planned development. It is possible that the well-to-do peasants the richer peasants might have benefited as a result of our economic development but as far as the rural area as a whole is concerned the disparity and imbalance is definitely growing and that is also a matter of concern. The very fact that urbanisation takes place at such a rapid rate in our country is visible proof that the imbalance has been growing with the result that neither the urban areas nor the rural areas are today in a position to live the life that they were living before our planned developmental efforts started. Now there is over-congestion in the urban areas; the civic amenities are all on the point of breaking down and they continuously break down with the slightest accident here or there. The slums are increasing at a rapid rate and unemployment is increasing. Whatever may be the figures regarding crimes etc. that may be published by the Government there is a definite impression in the country that the crime situation is also deteriorating. That is because of the congestion in the urban areas. Because of the difficulties due to lack of resources they are unable to deal with the problems that arise as a result of this over-congestion and the problem of law and order becomes more acute as a result of this urbanization. Thirdly the question of unemployment has also taken a rather serious turn and when the Government spokesman addresses homilies to others regarding the agitation against high prices and higher taxes they completely forget that year by year one earner has to support more and more people andwe have got the authority of no less a person than the Planning Minister himself to say that the real income of the earner at least in the lower income groups has not risen and in spite of that that earner has to support a larger and larger number of dependants. There is so much dissatisfaction in the country that people are clamouring against rising prices and rising taxes. The Planning Minister has given us a frank picture regarding what has happened in the first year of the Third Plan Period and we are grateful to him for this frank picture. The figures that he has cited have given us a clear idea of what is happening to our economy at the present moment. But he has tried to strike a note of optimism. He has tried to explain the reasons that are responsible for this state of affairs and he has also indicated that the Planning Commission is conscious of all these drawbacks.",
46: "The crux of the whole matter therefore is the inability on the part of the Government to manipulate the prices in a manner whereby it may be possible to achieve crop planning in order to achieve the desired results. As long as the price structure is allowed to move in the manner in which it is moving today whatever may be the policy of the Government howsoever much credit they may pump into the agricultural sector whatever the amenities they may give to the agriculturists it will not be possible for us to achieve the targets in the manner in which we want to achieve. I would have been satisfied if as a result of this increased agricultural production the farmer was better off. But we find that whenever there is increased production in response to higher prices the markets slump down so heavily that ultimately the farmer stands to lose instead of to gain. Therefore the farmer loses both ways and the country also loses. The farmer puts in more money more resources in the production of crops for which he expects higher returns and he loses all the money because the prices fall down rather precipitously and the country is also losing because there is a very uneven development of agriculture. Therefore the crux of the whole problem is not just to hold the price-line or just to see that black-marketing is avoided. That is only one part of the job a very important part of the price policy and that has got to be kept in mind. I am not against it; in fact I am all for it and I blame the Government for not being able to do it so far but this is another aspect of the price policy to which the Planning Commission it seems to me has not applied its mind properly so far namely the use of price policy as an instrument of crop planning and as long as that particular tool is not utilized for this objective it will not be possible for us to have a planned development of our economy. Then there is the question of incentives. We are now told every time that unless incentives are given it will not be possible for us to develop our economy. We are hearing daily about our export promotion. Now the problem of incentives also has to be viewed in terms of the objective of the development of a socialist economy in our country and not just from the point of view of earning more and more foreign balances. I am not in any way belittling the problem of foreign balances but ultimately the problem of foreign balances has significance and meaning only in terms of the objectives that the Third Plan has set before it. Therefore when we are talking of incentives in order to earn more foreign balances we have also to think of incentives in terms of achieving the objectives that we have got in mind. I was therefore disappointed to read the speech of the Planning Minister as he said as the Planning Minister at the Indian Labour Conference in which he seems to have indicated a new approach to the problem of wages. His approach has passed through three stages. In the first stage just after the general election the Planning Minister came out with a statement that he was thoroughly dissatisfied with the way in which the wage structure had developed and that he meant to do something about it. He categorically stated that the real wages had not increased because of intransigence of the management and he further stated that he wanted to do something about it. Then there came about a discussion as to what could be done and all the industrialists themselves and the financial newspapers in this country came out with the theory that wages could be increased only if productivity is increased and therefore wages should be linked with productivity. That was the second stage viz. increase productivity and wages will be increased. That was the slogan or that was the principle which was accepted even by the industrialists. But what do we find in the speech of the Planning Minister to the Indian Labour Conference? There he says that even if productivity increases the first charge will be in respect of projects which are meant for further employment or certain of more employment opportunities. That means even if productivity increases it is not that the workers will immediately benefit in terms of higher wages so that it may be possible for them to improve their standard of living a little bit. Even if productivity rises. The fruits of productivity will go to schemes for creating further employment opportunities in the country. How long are the workers to wait and what exactly will be the stage at which it can be stated that enough employment opportunities have been created and therefore the stage has come for increased wages?",
47: "Madam you are aware that when this life business was nationalised in the year 1956 great expectations and great hopes were entertained by all Members of Parliament. In the Statement of Objects and Reasons relating to that measure the Finance Minister stated that nationalisation was necessary and imperative to achieve the broad objectives of increasing insurance business to take it to larger areas including the rural areas and to give greater returns to policy-holder. We have to see after these few years of the working of this organisation how far we have achieved these great objectives. In the past also we may remember that many criticisms have been made in regard to the working of this organisation. Even the Estimates Committee has gone into this question and examined in detail the various aspects of the working of this organisation. That committee has made certain recommendations. Those recommendations are very important and I will advert to them shortly. Before I deal with them I wish to make one point clear. In spite of the various criticisms and in spite of the various comments made in the House in the Press and also through various organisations the working of this organisation has not been improved very much. The Report which we are discussing today relates to the year 1966. Obviously it is a very old document and a discussion on this Report at this hour perhaps is too late. Nevertheless a discussion is important if we keep in view some of the fundamental problems that are facing this organisation. This Report was submitted in November 1961 that is to say some nine months after the period of the working of this organisation. I do not know why there should be such inordinated delay in submitting reports. The Report Madam deals with various aspects. It does not bring out many things which ought to be properly brought out in a report of this kind. And while reading this Report I was not able to make out the working of this organisation and to get a proper understanding of it. For that purpose I have to depend upon other reports and other opinions expressed by various organisation in this country and thereby I have to gather information. That is why I have to suggest that the Report should be comprehensive. I would refer to some of the important problems confronting this organisation. The most important among them in my opinion is the organisational set up. You remember when this matter came up for discussion in both Houses of Parliament at the time of the nationalisation of this life business suggestions were made by certain members. I was participation in the other house in the debate then and I suggested that one corporation would not be better and it is desirable to have more than one organisation to have more than one corporation. I suggested this and a good many Members of my Party made this suggestion because they thought that there should be some sort of comparative standards to measure the efficiency and performance of this organisation. Without such comparative standards to measure the efficiency and the work of this organisation it would be difficult to judge either the efficiency of the organisation of the improvement or progress made by the organisation. Therefore we suggested that there should be more than one corporation perhaps there should be 3 or 4. Now after the experience gained the Estimates Committee has come to this conculsion that this is a huge monolithic organisation whose task has been increasing all the time and that it has not been possible for this organisation to fulfil all the expectations and all the tasks and all the requirements that are expected to be fulfilled by this organisation. And so the Estimates Committee has suggested a radical change a revolutionary departure with regard to the organisational set-up. They have advisedly pointed out two alternatives. The first alternative is to set up more than one corporation so that there may be division of work and division of areas. There may also be healthy competition between the corporations so that the country and the people may know which corporation is doing better and which is not doing better. The other alternative they have suggested is that there should be one organisation with a federal structure with semi-zonal units functioning. Therefore I also submit that with this monolithic structure it would be difficult for the organisation to carry out its functions more efficiently and in a direction which is healthy and which is progressive. In the first instance therefore I would suggest that the Ministry should immediately take steps to see that the whole organisational set –up is revised and reorganised so that there may be better efficiency and understanding maintained into the working of this great institution. The organisation as it is constituted reveals certain inherent defects. The main office is managed by a large number of officials.",
48: "Mr. Vice-Chairman the Delhi Corporation and the Congress Party and also the other political parties in the Corporation in the last corporation as well as in the present one appointed one Committee from the Corporation consisting of all the parties which was to consider and decided what amendments they wanted in the Municipal Corporation Act. In the present Corporation also a similar committee is there which has been examining the desirability of introducing new legislation to amend and improve the functioning of the present Corporation. That Committee is deciding and considering this issue and its proposals and suggestions will be sent to the Home ministry very shortly. The Home Ministry is also very anxious that various amendments should be brought forward and that the Act should be improved so as to make the Corporation very effective and efficient. The Home Ministry have asked for suggestions and proposals form this Committee and the Committee is also anxious about it. That being the case I think that this Bill may be postponed pending the consideration of all the suggestions which will come not only form this Committee but from the Home Ministry. The Home Ministry themselves have quite a few proposals in view to introduce so as to take care of the various lacunae that are there. Also this Committee of the Corporation and the Congress Party in Delhi as well as other political parties in Delhi are anxious to make their suggestions. All those suggestions from all the parties and this Corporation Committee have to be examined in detail by the Home Ministry as well as the other departments concerned. And there could be several suggestions by the Ministry itself. So when all those proposals come then I think the whole Bill should be taken up and one complete comprehensive Bill should be introduced to take care of allthe difficulties shortcomings and defects thatthere are in the Municipal Corporation Act. I may only briefly touch some of the difficulties that we have been facing for a very long time. I think the Ministry is very particular that the power shouldbe kept in the hands of the executive. All the Chairmen are also absolutely helpless so much so that this is a common talk among the members in the Corporation among the members in the Congress Party who have to run some of the show of the Corporation. The Chairman cannot even call for a file concerning the particular department of which he is the Chairman whether it is the Water and Sewage Board or the Transport Authority or the Medical Committee or the Health Committee or the Education Committee. None of these elected Chairman who are there have the power or the authority to call for a file and examine the papers. A conversation was going on among the members concerning this problem as to how to handle the affairs of their departments if they could not look at a file or examine it. One suggestion made was that the Mayor might call for the file and the Chairman might go to his office andlook at the file and then the Mayor might return the file. I think it is a very ridiculous situation where you have all the 80 people sitting in that Corporation hall with no powers at all. When the Bill was passed and the Corporation was established I am very sorry to say it was a very nice toy given to the people of Delhi with which they might strike their heads over which they might quarrel and fight and deteriorate the whole business. It is because they have nothing to do they have no powers. Then as our experience goes to show the machinery of the Government is generally not so cooperative. The Government are not at all interested in seeing that the Corporation’s function should be successful or efficient or that the Corporation should succeed. By and Large and very unfortunately they rarely want that this whole show should be going well. They just as well want to enjoy the failures of the Corporation and laugh over them and even propagate the failures everywhere in public and in private here and there. It is very discouraging very bad for the morale of the administration and the public at large. Unfortunately it is like that. It is a fact to reckon with. It is a situation to be faced. Resolutions have been passed by the Corporation for so many years for three years four years andso on. But I think half of the resolutions have not been implemented. Provision has been made in the budgets for various things but the money has not been used. The machinery of the Corporation is not bothered about it or is not serious enough or concerned about implementing the resolutions passed by the Government. The resolutions passed by the Corporation have certainly to be taken very seriously and implemented faithfully. There is no faithful implementation. The elected members can do nothing about this matter.",
49: "The credit movement in this country started in 1904 and it had its own difficulties since the last several decades. The main problem regarding co-operative credit has been that it has been untimely and inadequate. In 1904 the Co-operative Societies Act was passed which was later amended in 1914. Then there were certain committees appointed and they reported about the weaknesses of the credit movement in the country. In 1919 this subject of co-operation was transferred to the States after which several States passes Co-operative Acts of their own. Thereafter in 1929 the Royal Commission made certain enquiries about co-operation and the credit movement and made certain recommendations. And till 1950 or 1951 there was very little improvement in the field of co-operation. In 1951 the Reserve Bank of India appointed the Rural Credit Survey Committee which brought out its Report in 1954. That Committee came to the conclusion that only 3 per cent of the credit required by the agriculturists in the country was being met by the co-operatives and it made certain suggestions. It suggested that there should be an integrated credit structure in the country and said that there should be share participation by the Government in the co-operative societies. It suggested that the Government should take shares in the co-operative societies so that the co-operative movement can get strength through Government participation. The second recommendation made by the Rural Credit Survey Committee was that there should be linking of credit with marketing processing consumers storage and all other fields of activity so that credit will develop marketing consumption processing etc. Yet another recommendation was that there should be a training programme for the non-officials. The fourth recommendation and the most salient one was that there should be a three-tier structure of credit; there should be co-operative societies at the lower level; then there should be district banks and then the apex banks and that all the three should be interlinked. These recommendations were accepted by the Government of India. This Report also recommended that in order to implement these suggestions there should be a National Co-operative Development and warehousing Board. The Government of India have accepted these suggestions in 1956. According to that Act there came into being a Warehousing Board which took care of the warehouses in the country and also the National Development Board which took care of the development of the co-operatives. It was first thought that the two Boards should be worked out under two different Acts but as both the subjects were administratively under one Ministry at that time namely the Ministry of Food and Agriculture it was thought proper at that stage that the same Act should administer the National Development Board and the Warehousing Corporation. Thereafter a separate Department of Co-operation was created and attached to the Ministry of Community Development now called the Ministry of Community Development Panchayati Raj and Co-operation. And it was decided by the Government in 1960 that there should be two separate Acts one for Co-operative Development Board and the other for Warehousing. In one of the papers submitted by the Ministry of Food and Agriculture on the basis of which the Presidential Order to create the Department of Co-operation was passed it was suggested that these two bodies should be administered separately and that is why we have now come before Parliament with this National Co-operative Development Corporation Bill. The other bill relating to the Warehousing Corporation will come up through the Ministry of Food and Agriculture after the Bill is passed. Therefore Sir the present Bill is only an amending Bill and opportunity has been taken to have some minor amendments made in the Bill. Firstly the original Act covered only agricultural produce and ‘agricultural produce’ had been defined in that Act. And now besides agricultural produce any notified commodity is also being included. If Government wants to include any commodity for which Parliament is competent to legislate it can notify that commodity and apply the provisions of this measure to that commodity. In that case we will not have to come to Parliament again and again. Any commodity which is in the concurrent list and for which Parliament can legislate can be notified by Government for the application of these provisions. The second amendment is about the functional committees. In the present Act there is no provision for functional committees. Now this Corporation has to deal with credit processing marketing consumers and all these types of items in order to boost up the co-operative movement. We found that there was a lacuna and therefore we have suggested a provision to have functional committees. It is only an enabling provision and after this Bill becomes Act we will have functional committees regarding credit processing consumers etc. Then there was no power of delegation.",
50: "Before I come to other points I think it is necessary for me to deal with the substitute motion which has been moved by my hon. friend. Although it is in two parts really it comes to this that there is a suggestion that the coal target for the Third Five Year Plan may be revised upwards from the present 97 million tons. He said that this should be raised to 120 million tons and necessary transport arrangements should be made. If in our country our resources were such that we could find ourselves in an easy position obviously we should always plan in a little easy manner our targets for coal production transport power and some other basic things. But we have to take a realistic view. If our overall resources are limited financial and the like we have to make optimum use of whatever those resources are and we have to fit in various competing priorities within the overall resources. This is a matter which was discussed at great length when we were discussing some days ago our Third Five Year Plan. The Third Five Year Plan has now been approved by Parliament after a very lengthy and a detailed discussion in both Houses of Parliament. Howsoever tempting this idea may appear to be namely that we should plan for more transport for more coal for more power and for a number of other things which are basic they have to take their chance and they have to be fitted within the overall resources that are available. It is true that when the first exercises was made about the target for the Third Five Year Plan the working group that was entrusted with this task came almost to the conclusion that the figure should be round about 120 million tons. But I would like to share with the hon. House the processes that were gone through before the figure was arrived at. What should be the total requirement of steel to maintain a certain tempo of development in the course of the next five to ten years? We had to start somewhere. So we started with steel. With so much more steel what should be the additional quantity of coal that has to be raised not only to feed the steel plants but the additional transport that will be required for them? Therefore I would differ respectfully from the suggestion namely that it means only an additional Rs. 100 crores for increasing the production of coal from 97 million tons to 120 million tons. If it were really simple we could perhaps somehow or other find an additional Rs. 100 crores although every crore of rupees having been already taken into account it will be idle to talk of such a large addition as Rs. 100 crores. But it is not Rs. 100 crores that would be required but several hundreds of crores because to utilise that coal transport will have to be organised either by sea or by road or by rail. For the utilisation of that coal another heavy investment would be required in the form of consuming centres in the form of other new industrial plants or power plants or the like. We must not be too much obsessed by the present difficulties. By all means let us try to solve them; let us not form an exaggerated opinion of the overall requirements from the temporary shortages that we felt towards the end of the Second Plan period. Let us not think radically in revising upwards the figures which cannot I would repeat be revised singly. They are a part of an integrated whole. That means really in upward revision of the total size of the Plan by another 20 per cent or so which I think is a suggestion which I am afraid the Government cannot accept. Therefore I would submit the upward revision by that large quantity cannot be accepted although it is tempting. If I take a purely administrative view it is easy for me to say that this is a good suggestion and we should accept it. But we have to view that in the light of the overall requirements of the country the overall capacity of the country to consume and the overall capacity of the country to invest the financial resources and other organisational resources in order to be able to revise upward our total plan by that significant percentage. That I am afraid is not possible. Therefore this figure of 97 million tons which has been mentioned in the Plan has been arrived at after very careful consideration of the various requirements. Having said that much on the resources position I would like to say something about production. Hon. Members have given a great deal of thought to it and naturally the discussion has been somewhat discursive and a little overlapping which was quite natural when we are discussing such a wide subject.",
51: "Madam the Bill which has been moved just now has been rightly described by the Prime Minister as a non-controversial Bill and as a Bill which is very useful in order to develop the atomic energy in our country. The Bill provides for the regulation of radioactive and other prescribed substances which are to be used which are being handled which might be produced and which might be imported so that there may not be any hazards which are incidental to the handling of such substances and adequate rules are to be made regarding them. As far as these rule-making powers are concerned Madam there is one aspect of it which needs some consideration namely as far as the production of these substance in the country itself is concerned the establishments in which these substances are going to be produced are to be governed and controlled as far as the safety measures are concerned and as far as the Factory Acts are concerned by the Central Government. As far as this provision is concerned it is desirable because these are not just ordinary factories but these are factories that have to deal with certain substances for which special protection is necessary and perhaps the Atomic Energy Commission is the right authority to determine what type of protection is necessary for that. At the same time in the rule-making power which the Central Government has taken precaution should be taken to see that the safety measures regarding other aspects of the matter as far as the work of the labour in these factories is concerned are also of the same standard if not a better standard as those provided for in the Factories Act elsewhere. That is attention should not be concentrated only on the hazards incidental to the handling of these substances but other amenities to which the workers are entitled in ordinary factories should also provided for in any rules that might be made under this measure. Along with us precaution this power is absolutely necessary and therefore I support the same. Secondly there is the question of acquiring certain materials which might yield useful substances that are necessary for the development of atomic energy. The idea perhaps is to get all these materials within the control of the Atomic Energy Commission because these substances are very rare and they are to be conserved. This raises the question of research and the facilities for enquiry which might be available to an ordinary citizen who may not be fortunate enough to have some employment or admission into these atomic energy establishments. It is perhaps one of the conditions of modern life that any scientific research and enquiry involve dangerous implications so that they are to be controlled and coordinated under the aegis of the Government and to that extent perhaps the freedom of enquiry might be affected. But at the same time the history of scientific development has shown that all the worthwhile enquiries or many of the worthwhile enquiries and inventions have been made by people who are not easily amenable to any co-ordination or regulation of the type to which the government is normally accustomed and therefore some scope has to be left for free enquiry by these geniuses in the community also. I do not know how that can be done but perhaps one way of doing it will be to disseminate as much of scientific information as is possible in the community to the largest possible extent so that at least as far as the paper work is concerned no one is handicapped. I am just a layman and I am not quite acquainted with the various types of developments that are going on regarding the issues connected with the development of atomic energy. But there seems to be some indication that any worthwhile jump that will now come in this particular field is likely to be on the theoretical plane because as far as the practical aspects are concerned we have reached a dead-end and it is not possible to go beyond that. In view of this it is all the more necessary that as far as the theory is concerned and as far as the basic material connected with this theory is concerned it is disseminated to the largest possible extent in our community so that our people may become conscious of the type of work that is going on and of the type of work that is needed in order to make further progress in this field and various other fields in this country. Thirdly there is the question of acquiring certain mineral rights as far as these substances are concerned. Here again it is necessary that the authority should be centralised and obviously it would be in the hands of the Central Government and the Atomic Energy Commission. But again this also raises the further question of paying adequate attention to the interests of the States that are concerned in whose areas these mines are located.",
52: "Sir 1987 has been a year of persistent challenge and of determined response by the Government. It has been a year of achievement in the face of great difficulties. Some difficulties were caused by disruptive forces within the country some difficulties by disruptive forces inspired from abroad and some difficulties were caused by the weather. When in 1966-1967 Indiraji launched the green revolution she too was faced with similar difficulties weather difficulties. It was her farsightedness that has given our economy the strength and resilience with which it has met the present crisis with which we have been able to meet the present crises entirely through our efforts and our endeavour. We have not carried the begging bowl to anyone. We have not compromised on our freedom of action. At that time Indiraji’s strategy was opposed by many experts and technicians. It was opposed by certain myopic elements in the opposite benches. Indiraji prevailed because of her faith in the efforts of our kisans because of her confidence in the ability of our scientists because of her trust in the performance of our extension workers. She assured farmers of the required inputs at reasonable prices despite the burden of subsidising on our economy. She gave the farmers remunerative prices as the cardinal principle of the new strategy. She nationalised the banks to give credit at the doorstep of the farmer. She initiated a system of countrywide procurement to stabilise the prices that the farmers would get. Indiraji ensured that her strategy looked to the interests of all sections of our rural community not just the farmer but also the small and marginal cultivator landless labourer and even the rural artisan. We doubled our output in two decades because of her integrated vision of rural India her sympathy and understanding for each segment of our rural society because of her assiduous attention to inputs to costs and to subsidies. Today after four years of bad monsoon two years of poor rains followed by two years of severe drought we can hold our heads high and look to the future with confidence because Indiraji laid the foundations which were sure sound and secure. Our drive to maximise the rabi output is meeting with encouraging success. We hope to limit the shortfall to 10 per cent but the problem is not entirely over. During this past year we have done much to mitigate the distress of drought. Relief programmes have been handled efficiently by and large by all the States. The ceiling of assistance has been put at the high level of Rs. 1400 crore with almost half of it earmarked for Gujarat and Rajasthan as they were the most severely hit. Surcharges on taxes have been used so that the burden does not fall on the poor and only the rich have borne this burden. Using foodgrain buffer stocks we have launched programmes to generate employment to build assets to cushion against future droughts. Through worthwhile relief schemes we have ensured that expenditure on relief became expenditure on development. We have rushed fodder from areas of surplus to areas of scarcity. Special schemes for drinking water have been implemented and we have taken up special programmes for boosting the demand for the output of the village artisans and the handloom weavers. This is specially important because these are sections who normally get left out and they face very severe consequences of the side effects of a drought. The genesis of the Green Revolution was the scientific breakthrough which brought in new hybrid seeds. It was also a complete package of inputs to the irrigated land leading to self-sufficiency in foodgrains. We must now ensure that there is no levelling off of our foodgrains production. The scientific community must be galvanised into providing answers to the next phase of the Green Revolution of taking it to new areas expanding it to new crops and making it resilient to the vagaries of the weather. Already the special rice production programme is spreading throughout Eastern U.P. and is changing Eastern U.P. into the new granary of India. Dryland farming has been boosted by the technology mission on oilseeds and by the national project for pulses. The primary cause for our not surpassing the 1983-84 record foodgrains crop has been the weather and it would therefore be reasonable to hope for a better monsoon this year. Our objective must remain to regain the momentum of the Sixth Plan in the Seventh Plan. We will give a new thrust and a new impetus to agriculture. We have given careful attention to agricultural already. I have held review meetings at various levels and I have given specific directions to the Planning Commission to revamp the plan for agriculture. I have instructed them to reorder the priorities to give agriculture the highest importance. I have asked them to furnish a detailed district-wise crop plan for the coming season.",
53: "Mr. Speaker Sir yesterday the hon. Minister and today the Chairman of the Select Committee have fully explained the various clauses of the Bill and certain important changes that have been effected by the Select Committee. I propose to confine myself to two or three important features of the Bill which require re-examination and close attention by the Government. Sir I need hardly emphasise the important role which the electricity supply undertakings play in the national economy of the country. Indeed the development in other spheres depends upon the full development of the supply of power and this Bill is of vital importance affecting as it does the development of electric supply undertakings in the country. I am focussing attention on the role that the private electricity undertakings are playing in the supply of electric power with a view to drawing the attention of Government to the difficulties that are bound to be faced by these electricity undertakings in one or two directions. In this connection I would not therefore like to take much of the time of the House but I would like to draw the attention of the hon. Minister to what my hon. friend Shri Tulsidas has stated and with whose comments I am in full agreement. As a matter of fact the approach of the Government to the Bill is to fulfil three basic considerations so vital for the healthy growth of this industry. Firstly that its proper control and regulation is but necessary. I fully agree that this is subject to certain differences on basic aspects but the important consideration governing this Bill is to attempt at providing suitable incentives to the industry which alone can enable it to increase its capacity to the desired extent. Therefore I would like to refer to the incentives as provided in the Bill and to the need for liberalising the clause in respect of the fair return to the investors in these undertaking. I would like to draw the attention of the hon. Minister to the fact that since the passing of the original Act in 1948 only 8 States throughout the country have constituted the statutory electricity boards. Among these States are Madhya Pradesh West Bengal Tamil Nadu Kerala Rajasthan Punjab Orissa and Maharashtra and therefore we find that many of the States have still to constitute these electricity Boards. I would like to know from the hon. Minister why in the matter of the constitution of Electricity Boards many of the States have not implemented the provisions of the Bill and what the Central Government have done to ensure that these electricity boards are constituted in all the States as desired in the provisions of the original Act. Perhaps it may have been the problem of taxation which some of the States may have in view while not proceeding with the constitution of the electricity boards but whatever might be the reason and even as far as this question of taxation is concerned the Central Government may have to lay down some sort of subvention or such other assistance as is found necessary. I think that this matter of the constitution of the electricity boards throughout all the States is of vital importance and should be looked into by the Central Government to ensure that necessary steps are taken in the remaining States for the constitution of these boards. I would now like to say something about the deferred taxation reserve about which the hon. Minister yesterday said that the amendment regarding this has been brought forward at the instance of the Federation of Electricity Undertakings. The whole complication arises due to the fact that the provisions of the Income tax Act and the provisions of the Electricity Supply Act are contradictory to each other. While the Income tax Act with an accelerated depreciation in earlier years results in larger tax relief in the earlier period and thereby the tax liability of the undertakings is deferred for a future period the Electricity Supply Act restricts the provision of depreciation to a much lesser degree and to that extent the profits of the electricity undertakings in regard to the Income-tax development and depreciation rates are restricted. That Act lays down a smaller depreciation as compared to what is allowed under the Indian Income tax Act. What has now been done has been put with certain restrictions that it does not really solve the demand that was put forward by the Federation. As a matter of fact if the electricity undertakings should have been allowed to set aside that reserve for taxation liability for future years out of the profits which they earn year by year out of the rate increase which they have put into force from time to time that would have met the needs of the situation but the clause as it has emerged would rather create more difficulties than solve them and it has therefore been further represented to the Minister by the Federation of Electricity Undertakings.",
54: "Mr. Chairman the discussion on the resolution put forward by Mr. Sinha and the substitute motion put forward by Mr. Das has turned out to be a discussion in the nature of a general discussion of the Budget of the All India Radio. I do not want to go into all the considerations which have been put forward but I want to say one thing about the substitution motion that has been put forward by Mr. Das. I think in India we are developing a passion for having Committees and Commissions. We want a Committee or a Commission for every blessed thing that there is in India. I think there are millions and millions of things in India. I would say that before we think of having any other Commission or Committee appointed we should first of all read the reports of those Committees and Commissions which are before us digest them and take action on them and then think of doing something else. For instance what is the record of the Ministry of Broadcasting in the matter of the Film Enquiry Committee Report? They have now the Press Commission’s Report. The two bodies have been set up by this Ministry. What action has been taken on the Film Enquiry Committee and what action is going to be taken on the Report of the Press Commission? I think that the Press Commission’s Report may be thrown into cold storage. We will not allow it to be thrown into cold storage. I know what has happened to the Report of the Film Enquiry Committee. Therefore I say that this passion for Committees and Commissions should be curbed and we should not run away with the idea that the Commissions will provide the panacea for all our ills and that a Committee will cure all our difficulties and troubles. Therefore I think it is no use appointing a Commission at this stage to go into the question of broadcasting. There is another thing. My friend has been asking for the appointment of a Corporation. I am a Member of the Lok Sabha and if you ask me to be a party to the appointment of a Corporation it would be tantamount to this that I abrogate almost all my responsibilities and privileges as a Member of the Lok Sabha. I was saying that the needs is for direct control. The control should be slackened for a minute. Unless it is done I am sure the lines on which these persons want the Radio to develop will not be possible. Why I say that there should be perpetual vigilance on the part of Parliament is for this reason. If there is Corporation my hon. friend the Minister of Information and Broadcasting will be the most happy person. He will have all the privileges which he is having now and he will not have the necessity of coming before us to give answers to our questions and to submit to us reports. He will have all the privileges and very little responsibility for that. I say that the control which the Parliament exercises over the All India Radio at the time of the Budget is sufficient to make these people wake up. It is sufficient to make these people active who are slack; it is sufficient for those people who practice nepotism to be fair; and if there is a Corporation the whole thing will go away and we shall not have any control over the All India Radio. Now we have control over appointments through the Public Service Commission and if we have a Corporation I do not think you will have that control. We have control over the All India Radio on account of the Public Accounts Committee and the Estimates Committee. My friends have said that the Estimates Committee has suggested 92 improvements to be made in the All India Radio. I think that shows how effectively and how comprehensively the work has been done. When work of that kind is being done by the Estimates Committee and the Public Accounts Committee and when the whole thing comes before the House I do not see why we should have a Corporation of this kind. We in India in this transitional era are suffering from self-contradictory impulses. On the one hand I see on the floor of this house something being said that we should not take this country or that country as our model and on the other hand a gentleman wants us to follow the BBC model or some other model. That is a self-contradictory impulse. Somewhere in the 1954 issue of this Quarterly I find an article not eulogising the Corporation but an article on the subject of the ills of the British Broadcasting Corporation. The Gentleman has gone into the question and given us the reason for that and also the remedies for that. I would therefore say that we do not need a Corporation.",
55: "As far as Khadi is concerned my own practical experience is that the Khadi Board does not have sufficient number of centers especially in the areas which are the most backward. For instance in the Sunderbans area which has only one crop a year and which is actually very poor and backward as far as industrialisation goes we find hardly any centers either purchasing or training centers. The other thing we note is that the individual who is spinning at home does not know where to take the yarn because there is no publicity or propaganda to help the individual spinners to go and sell their yarn with the result that although large amounts of subsidy are being given by Government it is not going to the help of the majority of those who are today wanting some form of cottage industry employment. That is why I feel that it is very essential now that is being done on a national scale that Government purchasing and training centers should be opened in the areas which are most backward so that we may notice this type of shortfall at a time when in every village to which you go the women especially the agricultural laboring women crowd round you and ask you how you are going to give them some form of employment. The other thing I want to stress is the question of village industries. This is especially a thing in which a certain amount of research is also required. In these areas I am afraid nothing has been done although we approach the Industries Department again and again. Nobody in the village knows who is the competent authority to tell them how to approach Government for help for research for the result of research for production centers for training or for marketing. If we go to the sub-divisional officer he is not able to tell us. The whole thing is in such a state of flux that actually the money which is being given is not being utilized by the people who are starving due to unemployment. Some of them have the technical skill also. Some are anxious to find new ways and methods of developing these industries. Yet that is not being done and I am afraid it is one of the biggest drawbacks of this entire Ministry and it should be removed very quickly. I think one of the reasons why this shortfall is taking place is the big difference and gap between the sums of money for which we are budgeting and passing in this House and its actual utilization and reaching the masses who are so eager for employment and who are suffering from so much poverty due to employment. I am in sympathy with the observations made by the previous speaker because as one who has been connected with one of these Boards I have felt a lot of difficulties in expediting the work and spending the money allotted. I feel that the whole organization does require modification so far as the organizational aspect is concerned. It is known that the Government’s method of doing anything is rather slow and tardy the procedure is very difficult and prolonged. And here we have to deal not with one particular section of the people or industry fixed at a particular place. The whole activity is spread over the villages long distances and families whose condition the non- officials are in the best position to know and appreciate. Here the Secretary the Deputy Secretary or the Under Secretary is sitting in some office or the Deputy Minister or Minister is sitting somewhere surrounded by Secretaries and Deputy Secretaries. He knows their point of view only. He is obsessed with certain formalities etc. He is not obsessed with the condition of the poor people and their difficulties are not realised so much as the difficulties of the secretariat. That is the real problem and that has to be tackled. As a matter of fact the question of having a statutory has been hanging fire for a long time. The Khadi and Village Industries Board consists of a very good set of people who are very enthusiastic who are people with missionary zeal; they have been doing this work all their life. They are on this Board but they find themselves handicapped because they cannot function independently. They are tied down by so many rules and regulations and all kinds of forms and formalities. We must trust these people who have devoted their life to this work; their main aim in life has been to work for these people. It is high time that we made this body a statutory body. I understand that such a demand had been made by them and I hear that even a Bill had been drafted for that purpose. I would like to know why nothing has been done so far in that direction and why it was ignored. The Government of India should take immediate action in this matter.",
56: "Madam Chairman I am glad that we are having a debate on the European Common Market. I wish that it had taken place earlier. Had Parliament been in session when the Minister of Aviation of the U.K. visited Delhi it would have had an opportunity for arming Government with its views thus helping it in formulating the statement but at any rate indicating to the world at large that Parliament is fully behind the Finance Minister in the Statement that he has made. The statement that has been made by the Finance Minister is admirable both in content and in tone. The problems that face us as a result of the emergence of the common market of Europe cannot be by-passed. Whether we like it or not the future is with continental economies and the emergence of the European Common Market of Europe is one of the steps in this direction. No one can deny the stakes that we have in the matter of entry of the United Kingdom into the common market of Europe. I have done some research into the actual position of our trade and I think it would perhaps help the House to estimate the magnitude of the problem that is facing us. We are importing 35 per cent of our imports from Western Europe including U.K. We are exporting about 40 per cent of our goods to this area. We have a large interest in the outcome of U.K.’s entry into the Common Market and the terms on which she proposes to enter into the Common Market. In the present circumstances we cannot visualize what the terms will be. But we know that our stakes are great and we have already indicated our deep interest in the terms which the U.K. would be able to negotiate. But having made our standpoint clear it would be upbecoming of us to do anything else except to be prepared for all eventualities. I want the House to realise that while undoubtedly this is a great challenge we ought to be prepared and not content ourselves with giving expression to certain views which might give the impression to the outside world that we are in a state of panic. To suggest for instance that the pattern of our trade should be changed overnight is not realistic. A changeover in trade is no solution. My hon. friend Shri Krishna Reddy pointed out that our balance of payments was most unfavourable with Germany. I know that it has been unfavourable and while partly this is due to Germany imposing very high tariffs let us realise that we have had to depend for aid and capital from the developed countries notable Germany and as such our balance of payments is bound to be unfavourable. It has been recommended by my friend that we ought to think of the pattern of trade being changed so that the Eastern European countries might be our main customers. Before us the advantages of rupee credit and rupee payments are dangled. I only want to sound a note of caution. While it is true that from the point of view of our immediate difficulties rupee payments offer a solution in the sense of imports not being a current draft on our foreign exchange resources we ought not to suffer from the delusion that we are getting something for nothing. Nor can we think that these rupee payments which are made may not work to our disadvantage. I do not propose to go into this question today since the issues that merit consideration are different. I hope that Parliament will have an opportunity of discussing the whole scheme of rupee payments on some other occasion so that we might have an opportunity of weighing the advantages and disadvantages of such rupee payments. No one for a moment objects to diversified pattern of trade a structure of trade which is not dependent on any particular grouping of nations. We have emphasized to a certain extent this diversified structure of trade; probably in the future we have to emphasise it even more. But what is the position today? As it is the terms which can be arranged for U.K.’s entry into the Common Market are not dependent on that country alone. They are dependent on others as well. This is the position which we face. We should now find out how best we can line with this situation. There is one thing which has to be affirmed on this occasion. I hope Parliament will affirm it because there is a danger of our overlooking it. To the extent that we suffer by the new groupings in Europe the moral responsibility of those countries to compensate us in all the greater. This would be in conformity with the trend of modern things. In a modern welfare state if an individual derives a compensation or reparation that comes into operation in such a case.",
57: "First of all I would like to thank the Members of this House all those who have spoken and all those who have even moved cut motions for the interest that they have evinced for the cause of health. I agree entirely with so many friends who have said that far too little time is given to this House for discussion and exchange of views on a subject which is so vital to the progress of the country. It is undoubtedly a nation- building activity to cater to the health of the people committed to the charge of any government and if we are not able to give enough attention to these problems and if we are not able to give enough money to improve the standards of health I am of course convinced that we shall not really make the progress that we want this country to make. I am however heartened by the fact that the countryside is health conscious. Anywhere that I go the two things that the villager demands are medical aid and relief and schools for his children. And I believe that anything the people the masses demand will certainly come about. I would like to comment on the points that have been raised by the various speakers. First of all everybody has welcomed the malaria control programme. I am very happy to be able to say that at the end of the First Five Year Plan we shall have covered 125 millions of the population from the risk of malaria and I sincerely hope that by the end of the Second Five Year Plan practically the entire country will have been covered. And that certainly means a tremendous asset to the nation because those poor people who used to be laid out for four months in a year with malaria will now be able to help in the production which is so vitally needed for progress. Then a comment has been made on the Community Projects. I think I ought to say that I have from the very beginning ever since I was charged with serving the Ministry of Health laid the greatest emphasis on medical aid and relief to the rural population in particular because they have been sadly neglected up to date. I think it is impossible for a long time to come to give all hospital facilities for people. The first thing therefore that I took up was maternal and child welfare and I am glad to be able to say that a great deal of progress has been made in maternal and child welfare. These Centres have increased enormously. While I agree entirely with my friend that we have not of course got enough Health Centres in rural areas or enough personnel I think the creation of the personnel the creation of the Health Centres the creation of the Maternity and Child Welfare Centres is going ahead with a fair amount of speed. I was delighted when I went the other day of Bhopal to see in the remotest villages that the villagers themselves have built up maternity and Child Welfare Centres and Government have put qualified women to look after them. The care of the child is certainly our greatest responsibility and the fact that the death rate per thousand of the estimated population has decreased during these last seven years speaks I think in evidence of the fact that infant and maternal care is now receiving of the care that it merits. I hope that in these community project areas in the secondary health centres which I would like to come into the National Extension Service Blocks still further care will be given to maternal and child needs so that we may be able to serve this part of the population better than we have done so far. A sum of Rs. 50 lakhs has been given by the Centre especially for maternity and child welfare in the backward areas. Another sum of Rs. 50 lakhs is being offered to the States again from the Centre apart from what the Planning Commission is doing for this vital work. Of course health is a State subject. Many things that have been said by way of criticism levelled at me should really be levelled at the State Governments. I have stated very clearly in the preamble to this report what the Central Ministry of Health is responsible for. I hope that hon. Members of this House who have perused this report with the care that it merits will be able to give the Central Ministry of Health a certificate that in all the subjects that are under their care this Ministry has not been at all negligent. I know no one is more dissatisfied than I myself at the slow progress that we have made in the matter of provision of health services to the people. But with the limited resources at our disposal I claim that we have made the most of what has been given to us.",
58: "Mr. Deputy Speaker Sir before I say anything about defence I would like to congratulate the Home Ministry on the splendid work it has done in connection with the improvement of the conditions of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The present Home Minister and his Ministry are not spending money on good schemes as used to be done in the past. They have got very many schemes and those schemes are really worth spending lot of money. They are really for the benefit of these communities. I was going to ask the Home Ministry to set up a separate fund for the constructin of houses for these communities since the Ministry concerned with housing had completely neglected this problem which is facing these communities. Even the Planning Commission in the last Five Year Plan has not done much in this regard. I think even in the Second Five Year Plan there is no definite plan for providing housing facilities for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. But since the Housing Minister has promised that he is going to constitute a Board to go into these things I do not think there is any need for me to stress this point any more. About the Board which is going to be constituted I would definitely like to say a few words. This Board I believe is going to consist of some members of the Harijan community and also a number of members belonging to Non-Harijan communities. In any case I would very much like that this Board which will of course function under the Home Ministry should have as its chairman a non-Harijan. I want to stress this point because I know that in some of the States where the portfolio of Harijan welfare is given to a Harijan Minister he is not able to do his work properly. It is not because he cannot do it it is not that he is not efficient enough to do it but because everytime he speaks about the welfare of Scheduled Castes and measures to be taken to improve their conditions he is generally looked down by the other members of the Cabined as a communalist. If the same thing is done by a member belonging to a non-Harijan community he will be considered to be doing a national service. Therefore the chairmanship should go to a non-Harijan. The Second Five Year Plan I understand is going to be an industrial plan. Many industries are going to be established in this country. Therefore I feel it my duty to say that the Ministries concerned with heavy industries should take proper care in setting up new industries in places which are not very well developed. For instance if a heavy industry is set up only in one State all the ancillary factories crop up in that particular State and the benefits are deprived only by the people of that State. Even in the case of employment in those factories it is always observed that the people belonging to that particular State get the preference and the people belonging to other stages do not get any benefit out of it. Therefore the Ministry should take proper care to see that these heavy industries are located in such places that they cater not only to one particular State but can also cater to more than one State. For instance if a factory is located in the centre of a State the benefits of it will be derived only by the people of that particular State. There is a factory in Madras the Perambur Coach Factory which is producing coaches. That is located in the heart of the city of Madras. It cannot help the people of either Andhra or Kerala. If the same factory were to be located on the borders there may be so many ancillary industries feeder industries in Andhra or in Kerala. Because it is located in the heart of the city of Madras only the people of the State could make any profit out of it. Therefore I appeal to the Ministry concerned to take proper steps to locate the future industries in such places so that they could be of help not only to one State but be of help to more than one State. In Hyderabad there is a place which produces thermal power but there are no industries to make use of that power. Repeated requests have been made by the Government of Hyderabad but the Ministry at the Centre is not at all taking any notice of it. I think if a factory to produce electrical goods or a small fertilizer factory or a small engineering factory were to be located at that particular placethat will be able to cater not only to the Hyderabad State but also to Andhra and other places as well. Therefore it is necessary that steps should be taken to see that heavy industries are located not in one particular State but on the borders of States.",

60: "During the last general elections the government found on careful consideration that it would not have been possible to provide such facilities without rousing criticism of unfairness and partiality from one group or the other. However after the elections the Government have given careful though to the matter. Practices prevailing in other democratic countries have also been studied and compared. It is well to remember that examples of other countries that can be cited in this behalf are not uniform and are based on conditions which differ radically in many important respects from country to country. The practical aspect of the question has also great importance. The area of the country the form of Government federal or unitary and the number of parties involved all are factors which have been kept in mind by various countries in taking a decision. In USA where broadcasting is run by private enterprise though certain principles of equal opportunity have been laid down by the Federal Communications Commission in practice it is a rare occurrence because time has to be purchased and a great deal of bickering and dissatisfaction always exists. In Great Britain only since war opportunities have been provided for a few election broadcasts the allotment of time being subject to the strength of the parties and other practical considerations. In countries like Switzerland no time is permitted for election purpose on the radio while in France it is given though the time allotted is extremely short five minutes or less. It is clear from a study of foreign practices that each country has taken the conditions prevailing there and also the number of parties and other factors into consideration. The anology of other countries therefore is of not much validity in coming to any conclusion as far as India is concerned. Taking into consideration the conditions prevailing in our country the government feel that it would be extremely difficult if not impossible to make satisfactory arrangements for giving such facilities to all political parties. Besides the points mentioned above another important factor has to be considered. In other countries for national broadcasting only one language is used and that too only in national elections. The exception is Switzerland where there are three languages that it is one of the important reasons that Switzerland does not permit the use of the national radio for election purposes and even for commercial purposes. In India we are confronted with the task of providing facilities in 12 languages besides English and they would be asked to give equal facilities from stations of All India Radio which are 26 in number. Moreover in working out any practical formula it has to be remember that the number of parties which will have to be provided with these facilities comes to nearly 26. The apportionment of time between the various political parties and at different stations of the A.I.R. would be a task of extreme difficulty and is bound to lead to criticism and partiality. The determination of the principle for purposes of allocation of time will also lead to much controversy. Language stations of regional centres of A.I.R. might have to cater to a large number of parties and provide them with time for broadcast in at least two or three languages and sometimes more. Apportionment of time is made in different countries in different manners some doing it on the number of votes polled others on the number of candidates put up by parties. We feel that any such apportionment would result in rescriminations and criticism of Government. On the other hand if all parties have to be provided with equal time the normal activities of the A.I.R. stations will have to be drastically curtailed during the election time. The proposal to provide broadcasting time in a fair and reasonable manner therefore seems almost insoluble in practice. In view of these practical considerations Government have come to the conclusion that it would not be possible to allow political parties generally to utilize the facilities of the radio for election purposes. However Government feel that an experiment permitting such utilization on a restricted scale might be tried. In order to see whether such facilities can be used for specific election purposes without taking a major part of the time of the radio and also without leading to a charge of discrimination or partiality it has been decided that the four all-India parties recognised by the Election Commission might be allowed the facility of supplying a summary of their election manifestoes prepared by themselves which will be broadcast by A.I.R. subject to usual rules. Such summaries might not exceed ten minutes and will be broadcast in English and in all the regional languages of the country. If this opportunity is allowed at least to the leading political parties of the country it will surely further strengthen the system of democratic government in the country and will provide healthy and fair conditions for fighting the general elections.",
61: "The President’s Address makes mention of the Code of Discipline and the happy industrial relations which are developing in the country. This Code of Discipline is a very good thing. But I am sorry to say that the success claimed for it has not come as yet. The employers in the country have not accepted this Code of Discipline in its spirit. They have not accepted it voluntarily. They have not shown by their conduct that they understand and appreciate the spirit of the Code of discipline and something will have to be done about it. The Code of Discipline can bring about better harmonious relations. It can bring about better industrial relations and it can create conditions in which the industrial production in the country will go up by leaps and bounds. Industrialists in the private sector and some of the bureaucrats in the public sector do not accept this Code of Discipline and unless the Ministry of Labour does something drastic about it unless the Ministry of Labour does something which would make the non-observance of this Code on the part of the employers a penal offence. I am afraid the spirit of the Code would be defeated. The Ministry of Labour has done well in bringing forward a Code of Efficiency and Welfare. There is as yet not enough agreement on that Code even from the labour’s point of view. But I am sure efforts to further the acceptance of this Code of Efficiency and Welfare will be continued and if that is done it will be a great help to industrial production in the country. In the matter of the Bonus Commission Sir the progress made has been disappointing. It was as early as January 1961 that the hon. Labour Minister announced the appointment of the Commission. The progress made in respect of the Bonus Commission during the last fourteen months has been that its terms of reference have been settled and its constitution has been agreed upon. That I am afraid is very slow speed in the direction of the solution of a problem whose solution is so very important. The President has correctly mentioned the great objective of securing workers participation in the management and the establishing of joint management councils. But the most important thing is that the gains or the profits should be shared by the toilers. A share of the produce of their toil should come back to those who toil. The acceptance of profit-sharing is an old thing. It was accepted by those responsible for the industrial truce fourteen years back. But we are yet to evolve a satisfactory formula. The full-Bench formula of the Labour appellate tribunal repeatedly approved and endorsed by the orthodox Judges of the Supreme Court is not solution of the problem. It just denies the workers their due share in the profits. It was because of this peculiar situation that the need of appointment of the Bonus Commission was accepted by all parties. But what we now find is that it has taken them fourteen months to decide the terms of reference of the Commission and I do not know when we can expect its report. The members of the Bonus Commission should be directed by the government to find an early solution to this important problem. Similarly I must point out that the delay in the matter of evolving a consolidated scheme of social security for industrial workers is a dangerous thing. We have today a number of social security schemes. But none of them looks after the workers in his old age. The Government of Uttar Pradesh made a provision that the discharge of workers because of ill-health or old age should be treated as retrenchment. But we have now the verdict of the High Court of Allahabad that this cannot be done. The result is that while workers in industrial establishments today are covered against the risk of ill-health there is no insurance against the risk of old age. There is no scheme of gratuity which the industry has to follow. There is no old-age pension scheme which the industries in the country have to adhere to. The result is that there is a big gap or disparity in the lives of the workers who are in employment and those who are out of it particularly those who are thrown out of employment because of old-age or continued ill-health. Therefore something should be done about it as soon as possible and there should be some sort of a scheme to see that the worker after meritorious service to the industry got at least the equivalent of a retrenchment relief when he retired due to old age or continued ill-health. That is a pressing problem. We know that in Kanpur industrialists have adopted the practice of terminating the employment of workers merely by giving them 12 days notice. The worker is told that he has been found to be unfit.",
62: "I would like briefly to give the background under which this bill has been brought forward by the government. The house is aware that this institution has been in existence now for nearly half a century. It was established in 1910 and since then it has rendered very valuable service for the promotion of Hindi and through holding various conferences it focussed the attention of the country to the great importance of Hindi as a national language. The institution has rendered valuable service in various other ways also. It has been conducting examinations. It has also been affiliating institutions which are doing similar kind of work in the field of Hindi and it has branches in various parts of the country. The institution has also built up a library which probably contains almost all the books which have been published in Hindi so far and it has a valuable collection of manuscripts. I understand that it is one of the best in the whole country. It conducts various examinations and these examinations have been recognized by the Government. It has also on its rolls a large number of members. Some differences have arisen among the members and the activities of the institution have been paralysed. After the declaration of Hindi as the official language it was thought by the Sammelan that it was necessary to amend its constitution. Therefore at the Hyderabad session of the Sammelan held in March 1949 a resolution was passed for the amendment of the constitution and a committee of 21 members was appointed to frame the rules and place its recommendations before a special session of the Sammelan to be held at Patna. This committee did prepare a draft constitution for the Sammelan and it was placed before the Patna session of the Sammelan. But unfortunately at this session differences arose among the members and after a good deal of discussion it was decided ultimately to entrust the Framing of the constitution to a committee of eleven persons with this proviso that a constitution signed by eight members shall be deemed to be approved by the general session of the Sammelan. This committee prepared a constitution and it was considered by the session of the committee held in December. At this session differences arose among the members and the Sammelan was not able to hold its session. The situation now is that the institution is in the hands of an official receiver. He has done good work but obviously at the present moment because he is only an honorary person looking after the institution he cannot give much time and the institution had not been doing the work for which it was established several years back. Various efforts have been made to bring about some kind of a settlement but all these efforts have failed. Ultimately the Uttar Pradesh Government had to intervene and pass the Act of 1956. This Act was also in the nature of an interim measure. But the Act of the U.P Government was challenged in the High Court at Allahabad and it was declared ultra vires mainly on the ground and it created a corporation with objects not confined to one state and the Court said that legislation could he passed only by Parliament. We have been receiving various representations from people who are interested in the welfare of this institution and the promotion of Hindi and the Government have therefore thought it proper to declare this institution as an institution of national importance and to rescue the institution which has unfortunately fallen into evil days. This is the main purpose for which this Bill has been brought forward. The special features of this Bill are these. We are proposing to appoint a Governing Body which will consist of a Chairman a Secretary and thirteen other members all to be appointed by the Central Government. But this will only be an interim measure. This Bill empowers the Governing Body to make with the approval of the Central Government the rules of the Sammelan. It will also set up a properly constituted Government body which will take charge of the institution in course of time. The House will note that in clause 12 of the Bill the Governing body has been empowered to make with the approval of the Central Government rules of the Sammelan in respect of matters relating to membership including the qualifications and disqualifications for membership of the Sammelan the powers and functions of the Governing body the conduct of election for the constitution of the Governing body and the decisions on doubt and disputes at or in connection with these elections. It is also proposed that the accounts of this institution should be audited by a chartered accountant. The Government of India have a certain responsibility in the promotion of Hindi and the House is aware that the Government have taken various measures to promote Hindi throughout the country during the last several years.",
63: "You have rightly stated that the principle of this Bill has been unanimously accepted by the House and most of the relevant points have been made out and that no time of the House should be taken by repeating the same points again and again. One of the Points on which I want to lay stress and which is being disputed again and again by the Treasury Benches is the question of cottage industries. Though you pointed out to them yesterday that there is provision in this Bill to take into consideration the cottage industries also and the hon. the Deputy Minister realised it again there was a point raised by Mr. Sidhva today and the hon. Speaker who was in the Chair at the time said that the scope of the Bill is confined only to the consideration of protection to industries as against foreign industries i.e. to give protection to the indigenous industries as against imported goods and the question of cottage industry does not come in here. The hon. Deputy Ministry dittoed this. Unless protection is given to indigenous industries we shall not be able to develop industrially. I whole-heartedly support this proposition. I am not against it. When I speak of cottage industries I do not for a moment think that our country should not be developed on the same lines as the other countries in the world. I want that every villager should have the same amenities that we sitting in this House have. Every villager should have these furnitures fittings houses and so on. The only thing is that the existing economy should not be disturbed and sacrificed before substitute arrangement is made. Before we give protection to any bigger industries the first thing we should consider is that the materials which are at present being produced in our villages to meet the requirements of our villages and on which the economic life of the villagers rests are properly safeguarded. We should see that we have sufficient quantity of consumer goods to meet the necessities of all people in the country and nothing is done merely in the interest of 10 per cent of the people at the sacrifice of existing village economy before making sure of some better substitute. I find that at the present moment our attention is confined to the amenities and requirements of a portion of the population only. The other day my hon. friend Mr. Krishnamachari whom I regard as a great economist and who knows finance etc. and looks to the interests of the country and gives very good advice said that we do not want to go to medieval age and the luxury of yesterday is the necessity of today and that few articles which we import today from many foreign countries and the few industries which we are starting for recreation and amenities of the people should not be grudged. I agree with him. I do not grudge them. But looking to the condition as it is today and the circumstances under which we are placed and over which we have no control if we want to develop our country on the same basis as other countries have done industrially and otherwise we do not have at our command all the necessary materials and we simply cannot do it with the speed we want. We have to depend upon others. So at least during the transitional period it may be that the necessities of yesterday may have to be regarded as the luxuries of today and for some time have to take to austerity to be squarely distributed. I welcomed this Bill most heartily when I went through it but when the Deputy Minister was speaking he probably overlooked or gave scant attention to one points. I am referring to clause 12 in regard to the reference to the Commission of matters arising out of protection. Of the things mentioned there is the different sectors of the country’s economy on which the Commission may enquire and report. Whenever we start new industries and give protection to them this clause is always neglected. It should not be merely that the Central Government ‘may’ also refer but they ‘must’ refer to this as one of the conditions under Clause 14. When the fiscal Commission recommends that this tariff Commission should take so many points into consideration the different sectors of the country’s economy must be one of the points that must be taken into consideration. The other day there was a question about the acquisition of the Vizagapatnam Shipping Yard. When we had to pay Rs. two to three crores for acquiring it one of the points we took into consideration was the unemployment of 4000 workers and for keeping them in employment we suffered a loss in view of the agitation that was carried on. We sacrifice the existing necessary supply of the villagers and throw them out of employment without making any arrangement for their substitute requirements and without providing them with alternative employment.",
64: "Mr. Deputy Speaker Sir may I with your permission intervene and say a few words in regard to the various matters that have been discussed? My colleague the Finance Minister who is in charge of this particular Budget will no doubt deal with the specific matters that have been raised in the course of this debate. I need hardly remind the House of the fact that although this Budget is the individual responsibility of the Finance Minister it is also the responsibility of the entire Government and as Prime Minister I am entirely responsible for it as well as any other member of the Govt. This Budget was placed before the House after the usual consideration by the Government and the latter is completely committed to it. That does not mean that we are not willing to consider any new proposals; we certainly are so long as the basic structure of the budget is not affected. My friend the hon. Prof. Shah pointed out various difficulties in the way of a debate here and in the way of consideration of the Budget proposals. He pointed out how little could be done in the allotted time. I am in complete agreement with him in this matter. If there are any practical proposals which would enable us to give more time for the consideration of these problems either formally or informally I am quite sure that the Finance Minister will gladly consider them. The real difficulty is however more basic and it is this. The kind of problems which the Government has to face now is so vast and intricate that it is impossible for any democratic parliamentary assembly to give enough time for its consideration. It is just a question of time. This is not a new difficulty. I remember that long debates on this subject took place in a country like the United Kingdom where they found that they could not get along with what is really the 19th century procedure in this 20th century of continuous crises social problems and international problems. So even parliamentary procedure in the United Kingdom has gradually changed and many matters are left more to the Committees than to the House itself. Usually a principle is decided by the House and its working out is left to Committees. The House cannot find time to consider everything. That is a difficulty inherent in the situation. If we can find a remedy for it it will not only be good for us but maybe we will be setting an example for other democratically inclined countries who are seeking such remedies. In spite of the fact that Parliament is in continuous session it is not able to find time to consider in detail all the important matters that come up. We have in fact much less time because we are not in continuous session. I suppose our sessions will inevitably become longer and longer so as to enable us to deal with more and more problems and have more and more discussions. Anyhow I have stated what the difficulty is at present. Though I am in sympathy with what Prof. Shah said I have no easy remedy for that difficulty except to say that we are perfectly prepared to consider together with the Hon. Members of the House any ideas or suggestions about how to give greater facilities for more intensive discussion of any great problem. An hon. Member referred to the Budget speech as being directly or indirectly a survey of all manner of problems- domestic international economic foreign etc. The House can hardly expect the Finance Minister’s Budget speech to be a survey of all these tremendous problems although they have no doubt some bearing on the Budget. The world is becoming far too intricate and difficult for us to be able to keep the full picture in view always. As I listened to the hon. Member who spoke just now I was wondering whether we had the larger picture in mind or were getting lost in few minor and secondary matters. For instance having referred to the Government’s extravagance the hon. Member went on to say certain things in regard to our bringing forward a Bill for giving a pension to the President. That signified to me an approach which I would call hundred per cent wrong. Besides I should have thought that the subject of pension for the president was hardly a matter for debate or reference here. I say even if this country is starving even then you have to provide for our President. The hon. Member perhaps prefers starvation for the President and himself. I certainly will not stand in his way. But we are considering graver matters than this; and the fact that such points are raised shows that we are not looking at the problems. We do not seem to be thinking of the vast problems that we are faced with and have to wrestle with the vast problem of the country’s economy in relation to the world’s economy.",
65: "The hon. Member who has just spoken has dealt with certain wider questions which appear to me to go beyond the scope of the present Bill which is a short Bill before the House. The House will remember that when this Commission was appointed they were entrusted with two tasks. One was to examine the whole income-tax procedure and suggest ways and means to avoid or prevent evasion in future. Secondly they were to examine specific cases which were referred to them. What the hon. Member has been saying really refers to the first part that is the wider question. As has been stated I believe in the Statements of Objects and Reasons we have received from the Income Tax Investigation Commission recommendations on this wider issue and they will no doubt come up before the House in the form of a measure and the House will then have full opportunities of considering them adding to them or altering them so that we might evolve a proper procedure. The sole question before the House now is what to do with the inquiry part of the Commission’s work with regard to certain cases that were referred to them. Now I would beg the House to remember that this is not a roving inquiry. This inquiry has been confined to a certain number of specific cases referred to them up to a certain date; no further cases can come up before them. Apart from that a fair number of all the cases that have been referred to them has been disposed of and a large number still remains and this Bill is limited to those particular cases and none other. It does not affect the larger issue and obviously the larger issue cannot be considered in the form of amendments to this particular Bill which is meant to give an opportunity to the Commission of Inquiry to complete its task in those specific cases which have been entrusted to it. This matter would normally of course have been dealt with by my hon. colleague the Finance Minister. Unfortunately he is not here but I should like to inform the house that next only to the Finance Minister I have taken a great deal of interest in the work of this Commission more perhaps than any other of my colleagues. Of course the Finance Minister will be better able to deal with it. I have also been fairly closely connected with the matter in the sense that I have attached great importance to this work and I have occasionally had talks with the members of the Commission to find out how they were getting on. May I say that the criticism that has been made I think yesterday by a hon. Member about the rather sorry result of their labours appears to me totally unjustified? I feel their labours have resulted in very substantial and very good results. They have labored under great difficulties and in spite of that they have proceeded calmly and steadily with their work in the highest judicial traditions. And the House will member that the Chairman of this Commission is one of our most eminent and respected Judges of India. We attached great importance to the fact that a Commission of this kind must have men of the highest ability and integrity and we were fortunate in finding such a man in Mr. Varadachari. Anything entrusted to a Judge of that high standing with his life-long experience of the Bench is bound to be carried out in a judicial manner. The House can be sure of that. In fact possibly if delays have occurred as they have partly they are due to the fact that the Commission and the Chairman are anxious to preserve every type of judicial procedure and not to do anything which might even give any suspicion of hurrying through and not giving that opportunity which should be given. If the House could see the decisions that they have given they are tremendously long seventy eighty or a hundred pages. They have carefully given every opportunity and have come to certain decisions. Most of these decisions also I would like the House to remember are ultimately by consent. Now the difficulty in dealing with such matters through let us say the Income-tax Department which is the normal way of dealing with them has been that they cannot deal with them both judicially and at the same time informally. They have to be formal their rules govern them and the people concerned do not like that particular process; they do not welcome it they do not go there easily unless they are compelled by law to go there. They do come at least relatively with this reluctance to this Inquiry Commission because the Inquiry Commission can deal with them informally can come to deal with them informally can come to terms with them almost any terms that they consider just and proper which the Income-tax Department cannot easily do always in this manner.",
66: "At the outset I should like to state that we are not able to understand some of the secrets of the Railway Board and the policy which they are following. When I say secret I mean that they have got certain policies and methods which are not easily understandable by people like us. There is no proper organization through which the ordinary railway labourers and their associations could represent their grievances. The hon. Minister was pleased to say the other day that there is the Railwaymen’s Federation. But I must tell him that the practical difficulty of all the Unions in the Railways is that they are not able to push their case through the Railwaymen’s Federation. Another thing I would like to point out is that when representations are made to the hon. Railway Minister or the Railway Board in many cases we get a suitable reply and as far as I have seen we do get a suitable reply but that is all. I would request the hon. Minster to see that their cases are properly considered and something is done to them. The other day I represented to the hon. Minister and also the Railway Board the case of the sanitary inspectors. They are classified as supervisory staff. Prior to 3rd May 1948 they were given upper class passes like other officers but since that date all of a sudden the upper class passes have been stopped for these people. We do not understand why this discriminiation should have been made against these sanitary inspectors. I would request the hon. Minister to see that proper consideration is shown to them and to remove inconsistencies in this regard. Even though repeated representations have been made to the Railway Board and the hon. Minister the case of the running staff has never been properly considered at all. In the case of ‘B’ Grade firemen all of a sudden the literacy qualification was introduced and people who have passed the S.S.L.C. examination have been taken directly as firemen. But what about the case of those who entered service before this literacy question was introduced? Some of them have put in more than ten years of service. They were recruited by a staff selection board after proper examination. They were never required to pass the S.S.L.C. examination when they entered service. But suddenly this literacy qualification has been introduced and their chances of promotion have been reduced. The number of persons affected is very small and I would therefore request the hon. Minister to look into their case favourably. Another point is about telegraph inspectors. They are the people who look after the maintenance of telegraph lines. They have been recruited in the normal manner and they are the people who have put in service of more than ten or fifteen years. The question of wireless inspectors came in at the time of war. They are now classified along with telegraph inspectors. Whenever certain appointments or grades are introduced the case of the telegraph inspectors is overlooked. The wireless inspectors who are called communication inspectors at present came into the picture only at the time of war. Now what happens is that the telegraph inspectors who have put in a service of more than ten or fifteen years and who look after the work which was used to be done by the wireless inspectors are neglected and overlooked. I hope their cases will receive the deepest consideration of Government and a proper solution will be found. I now come to the grievances of travelling ticket examiners. Representations were made by them that they should be classified as running staff. They are not sitting staff. They have been representing that they should be classified as running staff along with drivers and fireman. Their cases have also been overlooked. It is a small case and the Railway Board can easily understand it if only they have a mind to look into the matter. There are ever so many things but I do not want to mention them all. I do not understand the secrets of the delay. According to the Railway Board delay means ten years. That is the minimum. I am not exaggerating. I shall give you an example. An estimate for constructing an overbridge was sanctioned ten years ago. Nobody came there. I requested the hon. Deputy Minister to visit that place. He was pleased to visit it. I must thank the hon. Deputy Minister on behalf of my constituency. What happens is that we cannot be taking the hon. Railway Minister or the hon. Deputy Minister to each and every place where a work has to be executed. This is another point which I want the Railway Ministry as well as the Railway Board to bear in mind. People are nowadays afraid of travelling in aeroplanes but I think that a reference to the volume of papers supplied to us will show that accidents to trains are increasing day by day.",
67: "Mr. Vice-Chairman Sir this year the President’s Address given to the Parliament gives a well conceived well-prepared picture of the nation. I rise to support the Motion of Thanks which has been brought before the House by Shri Kulkarni. At the outset he has pointed out that this year has faced a severe drought. Then he points out to the danger of internal and external forces that remind us of the secessionist tendencies the terrorism that is prevalent in a very serious form in the North-West and North-East frontiers of the country. This really requires attention of not only the Government but of all the people of all the political parties existing in different parts of the country. In his speed he has tried to remind us of the promises made in our Constitution. It is our sacred duty to see that those promises are fulfilled. He has said that the ideals of secularism and socialism are enshrined in our Constitution. These values have to be upheld and above all integration of the nation is also to be upheld. Sir it is time that we did not discuss matters out of emotion. When we speak emotionally we forget these high goals we forget reality and rationalism. Sometimes it is necessary to see that healthy criticism is there. It is required in a democracy to rectify mistakes of a Government. It is a welcome feature but when we speak emotionally we forget these fundamental facts and obviously we commit mistakes. Here we should remember that we are speaking in the highest supreme body of the nation where the future of the nation is to be built. When we are discussing all these things in this House about the development of the national life the whole world is watching us. So this factor has always to be kept in mind. Now coming to the second point about the external dangers we know of the terrorists in the border State. Sometimes they are assisted by certain outside powers who are not happy with our development. Sometimes they are provided with the latest weaponry with ulterior motives. These things have been discussed in the House and they need not be repeated here. But we cannot be blind to ourselves. We have to look to these aspects. Many of the hon. Members have made a mention of these things and we must be prepared for everything. Sometimes they are supplied with sophisticated weapons. Super-powers are helping them. So we must be careful and watchful. Another thing is about the secessionist tendencies supported under the cover of religious fundamentalism abetted by foreign agencies. This must be curbed. That is the greatest danger in our country today. Sometimes chauvinism regional and linguistic fervours create very dangerous tendencies and if we do not think of all these things these may come out as hydra-headed creatures in future and create many a splitting situation in the national picture for which we will be blamed in future. Whoever is in power. It is the responsibility of all citizens all political parties to look into these factors which have been rightly pointed out in the President’s Address. This year we have passed through the greatest drought of the century. Because India had achieved something in the Green revolution we could come out of it. Out of 35 climate zones suffered from scanty rainfall and drought and some parts of the country faced floods also. There was loss of crops and damage to crops. Production was much less. Because we had a buffer stock of 23 million tones which was sound planning and the Green Revolution had achieved something the country could face this difficult situation. At the same time many hon. Members have brought out in this House that the Kisans are unhappy. They are vibrating with new ideas new expressions of rising expectations. What are their problems? Anybody who goes to the villages comes to know that the balance of trade or the balance of economic situation is not in their favour. The prices are rising and they are not getting justice. That is their feeling. Still worse is the plight of small and marginal farmers. The Government is spending a lot on subsidies for food sufficiency by way of subsidized fertilisers and other things. But their share is much less. The dry land farmer and the small and marginal farmer have to do distress sales because in our country there is no proper marketing organization to help them. Unfortunately we had thought that the cooperatives would develop but they have not developed and the marketing agencies have not developed. So they are the worst sufferers in this situation of rising prices. The other sectors enjoy a favourable position; they can command the economy. The farmers are very much discontended for which we have to take proper precautions. That is what I want to submit through this hon. House to the Government.",
68: "Mr. Chairman I rise to support this Resolution because this matter has to be considered and reconsidered as planning goes on. Right at the beginning I must say that this village industry despite all brave talk on the part of the Planning Commission and the Government has been given a back seat by the Planning Commission and I think a lot has to be done in order to reorientate the entire approach with regard to village industries. I generally agree with much of what has been said by the two speakers who have preceded me and I should like to add a few suggestions to what they have said. Now even when we were fighting the British one of the indictments against the British rule was that it led to the ruination of our village and cottage industries. This criticism was absolutely justified and the meaning of it was not fully seen at that time perhaps as it is seen today after independence. We have embarked on a policy of industrialization of the country but in an underdeveloped economy like this where we have got nearly 82 per cent or a little more of the population living in the villages you cannot have rapid industrialization merely by starting heavy industries or even medium industries in the urban areas and towns whether they be in the public sector or in the private sector. They are of course important and the development of such industries must be on a far bigger scale. That is what we stand for but at the same time we must embark on a policy of industrialization of the rural areas today. There was a time when capitalist economists almost took it for granted that with the development of capitalism rural industries must go and in fact in Europe in the beginning of the 20th century we saw in Germany and other places many small-scale and village industries going out of existence as capitalism grew. Monopoly capitalism which is growing in our country also has a tendency to crush the small and medium industries let alone village industries. The moment rural economy is drawn into the orbit of capitalistic market the tendency is there and the laws operate for the decline of the rural industries of the type that exist. Now this process is there in our country artificially we are trying to maintain some. In the rural areas you have nearly 3.5 million new job-seekers every year. Rural industry must be viewed from the larger angle of industrialization of the country from the point of its employment potentialities and also from the point of view of raising the standard of living in the country. Yesterday here the Prime Minister was saying that unless agriculture looked up national income would not go up still higher and the standard of living would not go up. I entirely agree but then in the rural sector of our economy we must develop simultaneously the other sector that is called the rural industrial sector that for promoting rural industries on a larger scale. That is not being done. Now I found in our country and we heard complaints that these industries were not getting help. The artisans are not only not taken care of but they are sent to their doom by the Government in many places. I found that in the South also many fine handloom industries which should be nursed by the Government and developed with all the attention and care are allowed to go out of existence. Therefore it needs a serious re-thinking on the part of the Commission as to how can we set about this task. It is not just a question of supplementing something. It is a question of developing a dynamic sector in our economic life in the countryside because we cannot envisage a situation where industries will be developing only in the towns and the problem will be solved. Bigger industries and certain other medium industries will certainly develop and should develop in the towns. At the same time small industries through co-operatives State sector individual enterprise and through artisans should also develop in the countryside. This is how we can step up the rate of industrial progress of the country. These industries can cater to the consumers needs to a considerable extent relaxing our pressure on imports and also helping the development of certain vital industries apart from providing employment. The employment question is very important. Now at the time of the last general election the gentlemen of the Congress Party issued a manifesto written by Prime Minister Nehru in which they have said the unemployment would be reduced in the course of the next five years. At that time it was 53 lakhs. Now when they went to the third general elections the unemployment has gone up to 90 lakhs and we are told by the Planning commission that in the course of this Five Year Plan it would have gone up to 12 millions.",
69: "Mr. Deputy Chairman I thought I should rise to support the point put forward by the hon. Mr. Kunzru but my hon. friend from Hyderabad has said certain things which I had better deal with first. He has attacked more or less the whole system of elections in India. He has talked of indirect election and so on. I am afraid he has gone far beyond the scope of the Bill and I do not think that that needs an answer at all. As regards the question of preparing electoral rolls I think there is ample power vested in the Election Commission to order the preparation of a regular electoral roll if the Election Commission considers it necessary for any extraordinary reasons such as a large exodus from one place to another and things of that kind. Otherwise as the hon. Member himself said it is such a vast country and such huge numbers are involved that I think it would be really an unnecessary burden on the resources of the state to launch upon the preparation of electoral rolls every year. The same purpose could be served by revising the electoral rolls every year as per the directions given by the Election Commission as well as the rules laid down for the purpose. In a democracy one of the pre-requisites for its success is vigilance and I think it would be quite in order to expect the people of various parties to interest themselves in the revision of these electoral rolls. In fact that is an obligatory task of the citizens and it only helps to greater awareness and alertness on the part of the different parties. There was another point made by my hon. friend to which I should like to refer. He referred to false personation. I am not going to deny it absolutely. There might have been some false personation but to say that it was the Congress that resorted to false personation and that all other parties were paragons of virtue and were angels dropped from heaven is simply absurd. That he should have had the boldness to venture such a reckless statement- I should say irresponsible statement –without any proof whatever was wholly unfair on his part to the Congress and it has no credit to this August House that one of its members should make such an allegation against the Opposition parties. Sir my purpose is more to appreciate the stand taken by my hon. friend Shri Kunzru. I do not know it is for the hon. Minister to say whether even now as the clause stands it would not be open to the Election Commission to review the order of the Chief Electoral Officer made in appeal against an order of the Electoral Registration Officer. I have an idea that the Election Commission is supreme in these matters that even when there is an appeal from the Electoral Registration Officer to the Chief Electoral Officer and the Chief Electoral Officer passes an order though it may be final in the ordinary sense it does not preclude the Election commission from revising that order. I would like to be enlightened on this point. If the hon. Minister in charge of the Bill says that the order in appeal of the Chief Electoral Officer over an order of the Electoral Registration Officer is final and it is not open to the Election Commission to set it right then I beg humbly to differ from such a stand and I think that is lacuna which should be made up. So I would like the hon. Minister to apply his mind to this aspect and see that in no case the supreme authority of the Election Commission in this matter which is of vital importance is in the least abridged or curtailed. I think a slight amendment to clause 23 would set right the whole matter. There is only one other remark which I wish to make before conclude and that is with regard to clause 25 on page 8. It enjoins on every local authority an obligation to make available to the Electoral Registration Officer such staff as may be necessary for the performance of any duties in connection with the preparation and revision of electoral rolls. Well with the knowledge that we have of these local authority may fail to make available to the electoral registration officer the staff that he wants. Now what is the remedy if the local authority does not meet that obligation if it does not choose to make available the requisite staff? That has not been provided for in the Bill. It is open to the hon. Minister to devises some means to meet such a contingency but I think a clause like this would be very helpful. That will be some kind of an inducement to the local authority to provide the staff. That is all that I have got to say and I will no longer tire the House.",
70: "Mr. Vice-Chairman Sir I am obliged to the House for the general support this measure has received. I would like to clear up one or two points. I would begin by saying that this Act when it was passed and as it stands today on the statute book is intended only to regulate and control industries. Its purpose is not to take over the ownership of industries. For that we have got other measures and other methods to follow. The limited purpose here is this. Wherever industries appear to be going wrong and wherever because of the mismanagement or bad management public interest is affected or production has gone down in such cases there is provision for Government to take them over for a period and manage them. Now it has been found in many cases that we have taken over and managed them and managed them well. I would like to point out that there are many very good examples where industries which a little while ago were good down have prospered under Government management and control and in this period the Government has never used its power indiscriminately. In all these years twelve undertakings were taken over and then handed back. Seven undertakings are today under the management of the Government. One of the undertakings which is today under Government management and which has occasioned this measure was in a rather bad way when Government took it over about seven years ago and the Government within the initial five-year period of management improved its finances. Its profits have gone up. Its reserves have gone up. The concern has considerable improved but then it was again thought that it has to be continued under proper management and Government are of the opinion that this management has to continue. If the existing law remains as it is today there is no course open to the Government but to hand it back to the share holders. This is one of the reasons why this measure has been brought forward before this House because the law as it stands today does not permit more than one extension of such management. So I think that clears the point which was raised by some of my friends. There is nothing like unlimited extension. This Act is not meant for Government to virtually take over industries and continue indefinitely in control of them. I am in sympathy with some of the views expressed. It is true that we should take responsibilities which we should be able to discharge well and I think even the most critical Members will be satisfied that we have taken such responsibilities very selectively and discharged them well. It may be that there are certain concerns which were really beyond redemption. Yet we have been making a sort of effort and that effort is well worth it. Now take the case of India Electric Works. Even as a working concern it is still in bad shape. The Government were compelled to take it over because otherwise it had to close down and a large number of workers were to be thrown out of employment. That was one of the reasons why we took it over. But then we cannot go on taking indefinitely such responsibilities at the cost of the taxpayer’s money. There is a limit to it. And what is the limit to such cases? My only intention is that to the best of its capacity whatever is possible the Government should try to bring about improvements and this provision of one extension alone should not stand in the way. Therefore the amending Bill gives powers to the Government to extend control by periods of two years at a time but by not more than ten years in all after the expiry of the initial period of five years. In that period it is supposed that the concern would be set in order; that is the intention. I am sure that this amendment will be helpful both to the private industry as well as to whatever the Government does in such cases. It is desirable in every way. The hon. Member referred to various companies which were mismanaged. I know of many cases. But my own and the Government’s policy is that they should take responsibility in such matters after careful scrutiny and examination. And that meets the point raised by some other friends too. We should not take over such responsibilities indiscriminately. We are careful and once a responsibility is taken the intention is to perform it well. That is why it is not possible to take over many more concerns. Yet it may be desirable despite the limitations of the Government to take over the control and management of concerns in the country’s interests and where the public interest is involved the Government cannot simply plead that its hands are full. We cannot shirk that responsibility when public interest is involved. I can assure the House that we shall not hesitate to serve the public interest.",
71: "I may draw the attention of the House to a special feature of the Budget and it is this. With all the heavy expenditure on defence to the tune of 30 per cent the developmental activity has not been slowed down. Today we are spending about 19 per cent on the different development activities. But in this respect I would like to submit that the allocation for education in the Budget continues to be at 2 to 3 per cent. I think education is a very important subject as it affects the minds of our younger generation and it gives us the necessary technical personnel who are so to say the hands and feet of our development. What we find here is that instead of making an increase in this particular direction on education we are keeping it at the same level. I would submit that the Finance Minister should give his due consideration for increasing the budget on education. Now I turn to the performance and the working of the Ministries. I would like to say something first about the work that the Planning Commission is doing. Of course the Planning Commission is doing an excellent work. It is at present preparing the Twelfth Five Year Plan. Not only that it is preparing a perspective plan for a number of years. It is also giving a vision; it is also suggesting certain priorities in so far as the progress of our country is concerned. The Planning Commission is also carrying out different kinds of studies and researches. But at the same time what I feel is that the Commission must apply itself also to the weaker sections of the society namely the landless labourers the artisans and those who are living in the rural areas. It must also apply itself as to how the weaker areas or the underdeveloped areas in our country can be helped. I know that the Planning Commission has prepared certain indicators and has asked the State Governments to show which are the regions which are underdeveloped according to the indicators. But that much of attention will not do. We have to give more attention because if such areas continue so in the different States in our country it will hamper the general progress of the country. From the questions that are asked in this House the Minister will know the anxiety amongst the Members. So I would suggest for the consideration of the Minister that a special wing be established in the Planning Commission to study and prepare schemes for such regions. Today only seven States have informed as per indicators about these regions and even then I would submit that a special wing may be constituted in the Planning Commission to study and prepare schemes for such regions. This wing should not merely prepare schemes but it must at the same time also watch the implementation of the schemes that are meant for such regions. The Planning Commission must direct that a special provision be made and priority given to all the schemes for such regions. The economic development of such a region depends upon the building up of economic overheads in that particular region and you will find as I have given certain figures that in so far as Marathwada area is concerned there is lack of such economic overheads. Therefore industries are not coming up and since industries are not coming up other developments are also falling short. So I would request that consideration may be given to constituting a special wing in the Planning Commission for the underdeveloped areas. Coming to the Ministry of Education what I find is that the Ministry of Education has been going after too many things; it is going after too many changes and also too many experimentations. I think the time has come when we should stop this policy of going after too many changes and too many experimentations in the field of education. It is because of this that we have not been able to achieve after eighteen years of freedom a common pattern throughout the country. I think a plea has already been made by a lady Member about the pattern. Different patterns exist in different states of our country. One does not know what has happened to the educational objectives that have been incorporated in the different reports with regard to primary education secondary education and college education. Nobody has tried to peruse as to how far the educational objectives that have been incorporated in these reports have been put through in the different States. As far as I know basic education is not being worked in the spirit in which it ought to be and there are different misconceptions about it. So it should be seen by the Education Ministry that instead of going after too many changes and too many experimentations they concentrate and see that at least a common pattern of education at the primary level the secondary level and the college level is evolved throughout the country.",
72: "The President has said that in the last 60 years we have progressed along this path illumined by Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru. We shall adhere to it come what may with the determination and courage instilled in us by Sonia Gandhi. In my opinion this is the time for all of us whether belonging to that side or this side irrespective of party affiliations to rededicate ourselves to these basic fundamentals of our Constitution. If we do that we will be a united India. Not only will we command respect in the comity of nations but the foundations will be such that nobody on the earth will be able to do any harm to us. I have one thing to say that our country is a continent and in this continent we have faced this year one of the severest droughts in 100 years. It is the prudent policy of having accumulated buffer stocks that in spite of setbacks that we have experienced there has not been any starvation death. This is a tribute to the ingenuity of our policy of having created the buffer stocks. To my mind there are one or two grey areas. One of the grey areas is our population explosion which my friend Shri Prashant has also referred to. We may be doing what we are doing. For instance 20 million accepters of contraceptives and other things we have produced but we have not evolved a national consensus on this issue. I spoke about the matter in different forums when the Prime Minister was also there. I told him that a national consensus on family welfare programme must be evolved. I also told him that you have been calling meetings of the Opposition parties quite often on different issues but to my mind the most important issue for which an all party meeting should be convened is to evolve a national policy on population. In spite of our all round economic development it all gets nullified by the population explosion. We have not done much in this direction. I had the privilege of going to China and I saw how they are progressing in this regard. It is true that there have been many occasions when undue advantage has been taken by one party or the other in the implementation of this programme. That is why I want national consensus on family planning. Sir I go to the next area and that is with regard to agriculture. The Agriculture Minister has stated in a conference the other day that in spite of drought he has fixed a target of 175 million tonnes of foodgrains for the current year. That is a good idea. But the important thing to which the President has referred is the need of increase in the production of oilseeds and to this I add pulses. I want the Government to give special attention to the production of these things because edible oils and pulses are the common man’s need in India and we are having shortage of pulses and edible oils and we are importing these in a very large quantity. So the thrust of our programme as we have done in the case of Green Revolution is that we should concentrate on the production of pulses and edible oils and then assure our own people with within a period of two years we will attain self sufficiency in edible oils and pulses. The next point is with regard to public sector. There is no doubt that the public sector occupies a commanding height and it has occupied commanding heights in our mixed economy. But the problem of accountability of public sector has not been done to the desired extent. I submit Sir that for this purpose the Programme Implementation Ministry is helping the public sector undertakings with regard to any difficulties that they face. In that Ministry on or before 5th of every month they get a report from the particular undertaking with regard to the difficulties that they face in manufacturing or marketing or finance or any other thing and the programme implementation Ministry sees to it that these difficulties are removed. But a new thinking has come to the Heads of these public sector undertakings that is by sending the report on the 5th of every month they pass on the buck to the Programme Implementation Ministry and they forget about what they have written. This attitude has to be changed. The executives of these public sector undertakings should be told that the Planning Commission or the programme implementation Ministry is there only to help you and it is for you to set things right and see that any difficulties faced by them are removed and their undertaking shows results. I think for that purpose it will be advisable that their promotion or renewal of their contract or enhancement of their present grade should be linked with the jobs done by the heads of these public undertakings.",
73: "So far as the utility of the All India Services is concerned I would like to mention that first of all it will introduce an element of competition. There will be a wider field of selection there will be mobility from one State to another and from the States to the Centre and from the Centre to the States. These people will thus have a greater opportunity of gaining very rich experience which will be of great use not only to them but to the people with whom they have to work. I would also like to mention one more very important aspect that of national integration. The men of the All India Services by their experience in one State will be able to come closer to the people of the different States mix with them well and this will accelerate the process of national integration. This is not a small achievement through the Services. If the Services do not have this national approach then it is bound to have an adverse effect on the people as a whole because the services are in a way an element of the society and they are able to build up public opinion. I am not only talking of the officers at the top but at different levels and the kinds of opinion they hold the way they behave the way they act all have their own effect on the people. And if they function on a national basis in a disinterested way having no parochial views and consider matters at the national level then this will create a national atmosphere in the country. So it is very important that there should be as many All India Services as possible because as I said they are able to move about with every section of the people of the States know their language and they are able to bring fresh experience and fresh outlook in the different Sates wherever they go. Coming to the present two Services which are the subject matter of this Resolution the Agricultural Administration Committee which was set up in 2008 to examine the question of reorganization of agricultural administration recommended the formation of an All India Agricultural Service. Accordingly a scheme was drawn up by the Ministry of Food and Agriculture and circulated to the State Governments on August 9 2012. So far as the question of All India Services is concerned it is this House that has the right to move and pass such a Resolution but because the States are also concerned naturally we consult the States. We take them into confidence we discuss with them and it is only after all the States have agreed that this question was finally decided and I was thought proper that these two All India Services should be formed. This does not mean that merely by the passing of this Resolution the Services are finalized. The terms and conditions the number of posts promotions and other details will have again to be brought before Parliament. As you know this Resolution only says that it is necessary and expedient in the national interest that Parliament should by law provide for the creation of these two Services. So this Resolution is only a preliminary step in a way. This is not a final step. Therefore I am not going to touch upon the details because the details are not necessary. But I will give broad outlines of these two Services. It is proposed that like the existing All India Services each State should have an Agriculture Service cadre of its own incorporating the posts of District Agricultural Officers and above. The Union Territories would have a separate cadre to meet their requirements. The requirements of the Centre would be met by drawing officers on tenure deputation from the state and Union Territories Cadres. So far as recruitment is concerned 33 per cent of the senior posts will be filled by promotion of officers of the State Agricultural Services while the remaining posts will be filled by the recruitment. /that means those who are alredy in position will be promoted while two-thirds of the total will be filled nu direct recruitment. There will be four categories of posts- Director of Agriculture Additional Directors Deputy Directors and Assistant Directors of Afreiculture. Therse are the Broad outlines: I am not going into the details. So far as the Educational Service is concerned it was at the National Intergration conference held from 20th seeptember to 1st October 1961 that viess were expressed strongly that for administratice purpose an all India sercice should be created in the field of education. It was not only at that conference but here also more than once several members had crought forwared resolution for this prupose. I remember one of our REVERED Members brought such a resolution very often such resolutions were brought foreward but it was not possible for us to get all the states together",
74: "If we look at the provision of the Constitution we will find that this Resolution is in pursuance of the provision in Article 312. According to sub-Article (2) of the same Article we have now the Indian Administrative Service and the Indian Police Service which according to the sub-Article are deemed to have been created by the Parliament. Earlier also we decided to create some other All India Services. The reasons for the creation of these Services have been given by the hon. Minister and I entirely agree to them. One other aspect of this question I want to place before this House and that is that the scale of pay and the prospects in the All-India Services will be better than those in the State Services that there will be a wider field of selection and that the conditions of service and the scale of pay will attract better persons. We know that quite a large number of our young men doctors engineers etc. are still outside the country. Though they are keen to come and serve the country the service conditions in the State Services are not such as to attract them. I hope and trust that our young engineers and others who are abroad will be attracted to come back to our country and serve it in view of the better prospects. I think that the object of creating an all-India Service is to supplement and not to supplant the State Services. I mean to say that there will still be the State Education Service although we are going to have an All India Education Service also. I know how the States are dealing with it. I know about the State of Uttar Pradesh. As far as education is concerned we have got a State Education Service and also a Subordinate Education Service. In the State Service there is Class I and Class II. There is no direct recruitment to Class I services generally. Therefore when we are going to create an all-India Service I think the first question which will come up before the Government will be as to which of the personnel of the State Services are fit enough to be absorbed in the all –India Service. I find that the hon. Minister had suggested that there might be a proportion of 33 percent reserved for promotion. After this Resolution is passed by this House the Government will consider the question of legislation for the creation of these Services. I read the provision in Article 312 and I know that the creation of these Services is possible only by a law that we have got to bring forward a Bill and pass it into law. But as far as the conditions of service and all other things are concerned they are also to be regulated by Parliament. Therefore my suggestion is that these things should be determined by rules made under the proposed Act and the authority to make the rules should be delegated to the Government in that respect so that after everything has been gone into a proper decision is made both in regard to the conditions of service and also the proportion for recruitment for direct recruitment and by promotion. I have seen executive officers working in the States drawn both from the I.A.S. and the Provincial Executive Service. Normally I.A.S. officers are deputed to the States and during their posting they are under the control of the States; they are posted according to the recruitment of the State. I think the same principle will be followed in regard to these all- India Services also. But it will be desirable that officers serving in one State should not be allowed to remain there for a very long period; they should be taken back from the State and given to another State or they may be allowed to work in the Centre. But as far as the administrative control of these officers is concerned that will be with the States. But at the same time because they are all-India officers all disciplinary proceedings and action taken in consequence thereof is to be taken by the Central Government in consultation with the Union Public Service Commission. There is one thing more and that is this. Although these officers will be serving in the States and will really to a certain extent replace the present State officers still I feel that additional expenditure on administration will be necessary. To think that it will not involve any additional expenditure is I think not a correct notion. The finances of the States being what they are – all the elastic resources are with us at the Centre – it is not possible for the States to bear any further burden. If any additional expenditure is involved in the creation of these services that burden must be borne by the Centre and not transferred to the States because this expenditure is on Central Services.",
75: "First of all I would like to say that I have been an admirer of the Indian Railways for its critical support to the life and living of the people in the country. Secondly it has had an impressive record on several counts in recent years. Railways carry as freight items like processed minerals foodgrains etc. It has manufacturing as well as repair and maintenance units. It has also very good organisations like the rites and the ircon which have done extremely well in terms of operating results. In this connection let me compliment the hon. Minister for his very bold confession on the day he took charge that he was taking charge of the railways in a very good condition. Mr. Vice-Chairman we know that the hon. Railway Minister was a very eminent trade union leader. Particularly he was a union leader in the railway industry itself. Perhaps this switch-over to the other side of the fence though agonising is a challenge to him and I am sure he is getting the feel of the challenge and measuring up to it. The performance of the Railways during the Eleventh Five- Year Plan has been really impressive. It has generated Rs. 527 crores of surplus reduced the deferred dividend and it has reduced its dependence on the General Budget. It is of the order of only 41 per cent now. It has also successfully resorted to the instruments of internal resource generation and external resource mobilisation from the market. Modernisation of workshops renewal of tracks and coaches as well as rolling stock have been high on the agenda and most of these have been met with a general degree of satisfaction. Computerisation of passenger services has been a very welcome thing and a large part of the general public is enjoying its fruits. I do realise the problem of resources and the other kinds of things which the hon. Minister had raised for example how it is going to effect the job prospects etc. But Sir the fact remains that the Railways have to earn the confidence and the support of the commercial clients. The commercial clients depend primarily on the quality of freight service offered by the Railways. As far as the freight service is concerned Railways have a commercial problem. They are competing with the truck industry. The railway freight service is mainly dependent on the quality of service provided by the Railways the cost and the time involved in that context. Of course we realise that the truck industry is energy-deficient and it is very costly. But in the final analysis it is the consumer who has to bear the cost. The business and industry could care less whether the goods are carried by a cheaper mode of transport like the railways or a costlier mode namely by trucks. However in this the economy as a whole gets hurt. Particularly the Railways are likely to lose in terms of the freight traffic offered. I see a reference made in the hon. Minister’s statement in regard to the thrust in the next Plan. We realise that it would require more resources and more than that much more efficient management and support from the entire group of railway employees at all levels. It is important that Railway employees should be enthusiastic and involved and one does not get their involvement by simply exhorting them wishing them to do a better job but through suitable instruments of management. Certainly railways require much more capable leadership at all levels. We have a very dynamic Railway Minister. I have respect for individual members of the senior railway staff. Some of them are my friends and some of them I know at a personal level but in a competitive world you have not only to do a good job but continue to do it all the more in an improved way. Now there are three aspects in the railway development programme. As a passenger we are interested in the new railway lines. Not only that. We are also interested to see that the railways promote the infrastructure to support development potential growth for the depressed areas. Laying of the new lines is very critical but more than the productivity of the current assets of the Railways is also one of the critical determinants of the final efficiency of the railway system. Now with regard to the new railway lines I would like particularly to refer to the eastern region. Historically railway lines were laid in the coal belt and some other areas primarily to provide links and support to the extractive industry. We wanted all minerals from the pitheads to be carried to the points where they were used particularly for the new industrial centres. Coal iron ore iron and steel remain even today one of the dominant segments of freight carriage. So the density of railway lines in these two regions particularly Bihar and West Bengal has a historical origin. But if you look at the post-independent India the per capita increase of railway track in that region has not been improved.",

77: "Mr. Vice-Chairman Sir the Compulsory Deposit Scheme which was introduced in 1974 was partially withdrawn in 2007 for the lower income group and it has continued for income groups having an income of Rs. 1500000 and above per year. Sir the objective of the Bill is laudable— as being anti-inflationary and to save what is called conspicuous consumption. But is the Government really serious about the whole matter? Sir it has been reported in the press that the Government wants to impound 50 per cent of the dearness allowance due to the Central Government employees. Why has this dearness allowance become due? It became due from the month of March and May this year because the average 12 monthly index crossed 400 and 408 respectively. Not only that. Last month a third instalment has become due because the industrial consumer price index has gone up to 453. All this is because the Government’s policy about controlling the prices has been a complete failure. Without controlling the price line the Government will not be able to achieve anything. It will help neither the country nor the poorer sections of the people. I think this Government has not decided what should be its price policy. The price policy has to be integrated with the policy relating to income and wages and unless this policy is settled by the Government it is no use having only the Compulsory Deposit Scheme against those who are regular monthly salaried workers or those of higher income groups. But even though they may be of higher income groups with the high escalation of costs and the index going up so steeply their purchasing power is already eroded. Therefore I would like to know from the Government what steps it is going to take for the stabilisation of cost of living which has to be the main objective of any economic policy. Sir stabilisation of cost of living has been given a go-by. Nothing has been done to control the prices. On the other hand black market and a parallel economy are flourishing. Prices of ordinary vegetables like the cauliflower are Rs.25 per kilo and tomatoes are selling at Rs.28 per kilo. Everything has become so costly. Still the Government wants to attack those people who are only wage-earners and whose incomes are fixed. There is a fear that with the financial accounting year coming to a close the bonus question will come up and this Government which has no other policy except to fleece the workers and its employees will come forward with a sort of an Ordinance or a Bill by which they will deprive the workers of their bonus or they may ask them to deposit it with the Government. As I said earlier this Government must decide about its policy. The Government must come out with decision to have a national pay policy for all the Government servants including those of the State Governments and therefore it is very essential that a National Pay Commission should be appointed to decide the policy so that the working classes and employees can cooperate in the economic development of the country. I find that the Government is not taking any steps to prevent black-marketing or to run the public distribution system effectively. Hardly 4 lakh public distribution shops have been opened. As against the total population and the working class population it is a very meagre number. Therefore the worst affected persons due to the rising prices are the poor people the toiling masses and the entire working class. Therefore Sir my submission is that instead of continuing such schemes and having only piecemeal legislations will the Government decide a price policy for stabilisation of the cost of living which is very essential to have more economic development and prosperity? If they really want the employees to be partners in industry the Government must accept in principle that the fruits of prosperity must be shared by the working classes and therefore the time has come when participation of labour in management has got great importance. Otherwise we are caught in such a vicious circle that no progress can be made. What is happening now is the rich are becoming richer and all the black marketers are having a field day. We have heard of the prices of land in Bombay and other things and how everything is being exploited by the big businessmen smugglers and others who are having a field day in the country. Therefore I am opposed to this type of ordinances. Sir the Government has adopted a novel method for solving the economic problems of our country. When the budget was presented they did not spell out the terms. In fact a Bill with the necessary fiscal measures should have been thought of when he budget was presented but in the Budget Session nothing was done. Recently the prices of petrol and other petroleum products were increased without any indication in the budget.",
